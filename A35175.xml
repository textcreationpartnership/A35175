            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His little Book is brought forth in due Seaſon, to Congratulate your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration into an Office of that Truſt and Honour, that admits no Citizen in <hi>Europe</hi> to be your Equal: The Subject of it is ſuch, as not only becomes the greateſt Prince, as well as meaneſt Peaſant to Study, but it is abſolutely Neceſſary they ſhould; for none of their Affairs are of ſo great a Concern, as the Pardon of their Sin, and the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Souls. Yet I am ſo diſtruſtful of my Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:50846:3"/> of ſo great a Subject, that neither this, nor the Honour of your Acquaintance, nor the Knowledge of your Impartial Judgment, or Condeſcending Temper, had prevailed with me to prefix your Name to it, tho' I often did deliberate upon it; but its Edition ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following your Election, and its Publication being within the Verge, and under the firſt Dawnings of your Authority, it could not be Civil without Saluting you, and Craving your Patronage; and it gives me the Opportunity to tell You, that I, and I believe thouſands more, who have no Vote of Election, do enjoy our Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and are put in great hopes of a Reformed City.</p>
            <p>I bope you will be as far from Patronizing Error as Protecting Vice, but there is nothing in this little Piece (to my Knowledge) contrary to the Confeſſions of our common Proteſtant Faith. Indeed there is a Notion about Faith, that I may call <hi>New,</hi> in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the Author of our Faith, is the Author of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Chriſt Jeſus, and the Object of our Faith the Merit of our Juſtification, Chriſts Righteouſneſs; and the Exerciſe of our Faith upon this Merit, as the great Mean through which Divine Love, Grace and Mercy is conveyed to us, is the Condition of our Juſtification; ſo the Gift of Faith is the Sentence of our Juſtification, or Sign of it; for if the Spirit be an Earneſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, much more is it of Pardon: It's true, by this
<pb facs="tcp:50846:3"/> the Gift is before the Condition, which all grant; but the Sign or Signification of the Gift, which is the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, is at leaſt in order of Nature after the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for we not only do not perceive, but we cannot perceive this Gift; and conſequently it cannot ſignifie divine Favour to us, untill mixt with our spirit; for our Obſervation is from our Experience. This being new, I have propoſed it to be tried before truſted; a Conditionality of the Covenant is a principal Pillar of <hi>Popery, Socinianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> according to their ſeveral modes of Explication; and therefore the very ſound of the Word fills the Heart of ſincere <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with Jealouſie: But if we allow Faith and Repentance, thoſe abſolute Gifts, and Effects of ſpecial Grace, to be Signs of ſpecial Grace and Favour, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, (for a Man cannot be in a ſtate of Grace without Pardon) there is room for Duty, and Conditional Duty, without any Jealouſie of theſe Errors.</p>
            <p>I pray the Lord may Confirm your Election with ſuch an Unction that may ſignifie his own Approbation of you, Mercy to us by You, and that may fit you fully for the place. It is a Place that never wanted Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, nor are they like to decreaſe in your Day; the greater they grow, the more Need you have of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Fruition of Him, who is <hi>of God made unto us Wiſdom</hi> as well as <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi> as well as a <hi>Saviour;</hi> his providential Conduct
<pb facs="tcp:50846:4"/> in immediate directing of the Judgment, and Inclining of the Will of his Favourites, when plunged in difficult Affairs, or ſurrounded with dangerous Circumſtances, fully ſupplies the want of <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt the Hopes of ſo many People being termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on You, and ſo great things being expected from You, renders you concerned; but both of them may as truly encourage you: For what do we expect, but that you be of a Publick Spirit, that your Aims and Ends be as publick as your Place and Office, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth, or the common Good of the City? It's but of late that People have enjoyed this Security, that their moſt Supream Magiſtrates are in no private Plott againſt their common Good; but tho we are now ſecure as to the Throne, we are not as to all Places of Truſt under it.</p>
            <p>What do we expect, but the Impartial Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, to <hi>great</hi> or <hi>ſmall, high</hi> or <hi>low, rich</hi> or <hi>poor, friend</hi> or <hi>foe?</hi> However unjuſt Mens Actions are, their Conſciences will cry, <hi>It is juſt, it is juſt,</hi> when they ſuffer moſt ſevere Puniſhment for their Crimes: <hi>Honeſty is the beſt Policy,</hi> and needs leaſt the Volumes of Politick Axioms; an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſingle-hearted Man, with a general Notion of the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Land, will do more Service with a few obvious Rules, that almoſt every man knows, than a Cunning Man can with all his
<pb facs="tcp:50846:4"/> Skill, when he makes uſe of it for upholding him out of the Road of Equity and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>What do we expect, but that the Prophanity of this City ſhould now meet with an Hearty Enemy in the Chair? and you have a Notable Opportunity for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf ſo, Wickedneſs being grown to that height, that it is an Injury, yea, a Ruine to many Families, who could wink at it while it remained only under the Form of a Sin or an Offence. He that will become a Check and a Terror to it now, will receive the Praiſe, and enjoy the Hearts of all Parties, who would not have their Poſterity rot in Bawdy-houſes, or made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Examples of Juſtice at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> or their Eſtates purchaſed by labour and induſtry, or preſerved by pains, parcimony and prudence, drank away in Taverns, or thrown away at a Game. You will become the City's great Benefactor, in delivering it from ſuch a Ruine, You will receive an Honour far above the Honour of your Office, if it may be recorded, that Profanity, which has ſo long increas'd, did decay, and receive its Deaths-wound under the Maioralty of Sir <hi>William Aſhurſt.</hi> A zealous acting againſt Vice and Profani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will not only be for your Honour, and the City's good, but it will be an acting for God, who <hi>is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</hi> the nigher you are brought to him, the more you ought to be like him; the more he Honours you, the more you ought to Honour him:
<pb facs="tcp:50846:5"/> He has generally given to you the Hearts of the City, will you ſuffer that Kindneſs to be in vain? He hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both Strength and Reward for his Work; truſt him, he is ſurely faithfull; but never truſt his Enemies; you may gain your own perſonal Foes by Favours, but never think to make God's Foes your Friends, if you intend to act for God; you may ſooner loſe ten Friends than gain one of them; all your Favours will only make them Ridicule you, if not put them in a Capacity to Injure you.</p>
            <p>Not only may the things expected, but the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, encourage you in the Adminiſtration of your Office; for they who truly hope for ſuch things at your hand, will be conſtant Supplicants at the Throne of Grace, for Piety, Prudence, Patience, Candor and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, for you. That you may not only have a Power Faithfully to diſcharge your Truſt, but with Eaſe, Pleaſure and Succeſs, you may perform every Duty of the Station, and at laſt deſcend from the Chair with an Honour greater than the Hope and Joy of your Friends at your Aſcenſion to it, in this Catalogue he counts it his Honour to be, who is</p>

            <p>THe Doctrine contain'd in this Verſe is of great Moment, and requires our moſt earneſt Attention and moſt nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſearch and enquiry into its Nature and all its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; for it is, How ſhall we be Juſtified before God? how ſhall we behave our ſelves before ſuch an awful Tribunal? <hi>When he riſeth up, what ſhall I do? and when he Viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer?</hi> ſays Holy <hi>Job; Wherewith ſhall we come before the Lord, and bow our ſelves before the moſt High? will he be pleas'd with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams, or ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl? ſhall I give my Firſt-born for my Tranſgreſſion, the Fruit of my Body for the Sin of my Soul?</hi> That God would plead with <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>All things are naked and open to the Eyes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50846:10"/> of him with whom we have to do.</hi> If there be a God there is a Governour, and if there be a Governour there muſt be a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Can we be his Creatures and his Subjects, and will he be ſo Careleſs as not to take an Account of us? Humane Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is but an Image of his: There can be no Shaddow without a Subſtance. Doth a Summons from Man fright us? Doth the very Name of an Arraignment, a Court, a Judge, an Appearance at a Humane Barr, ſhake off our Security, and rouſe our Phlegmatick Conſtitution, and put us into a moſt ſerious thinking frame, and ſhall not the certain Warning of this rouſe us out of our ſleepy Condition, and entirely monopolize our Thoughts? Yet becauſe of our Dullneſs to hear things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Eternal State, I ſhall propoſe theſe Helps to render us ſerious about it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Majeſty and Holineſs of the Judge, the Voice of the Arch-Angel, the Trump of God, the Train of Saints, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appearance at the Great Day, will add nothing to it; he is as Holy, as Juſt, as Powerful now as then, as nigh to us now as then: When his Seat is upon the Conſcience, is he not as nigh as when he makes a Cloud his Theatre? the Matter to be try'd the ſame now that then, all the Buſineſs of that Day depends upon this: A ſight of this God by Faith, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of our being now in his Preſence, would put us in the ſame frame we ſhall be in then, as we may ſee from <hi>Job</hi> 40.4, 5. &amp; 42.5. <hi>Behold I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer? I will lay my hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Mouth, once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer: I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhorr my ſelf in duſt and aſhes. Job</hi>'s Faith would make <hi>Job</hi>'s Temper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Exactneſs of the Law we are under as his Creatures; it's holy, juſt and good, it allows not, nor indulges any Sin, in Thought, Word or Deed, and is fenc'd with the moſt ſevere Sanction; <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye: Curſed is he that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. This may fill Sinners with Terror, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The Sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſs hath ſurpriz'd the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite; who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Condition; Sinners, Tranſgreſſors of this Law, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels againſt this Sovereign God: <hi>There is none righteous, no not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50846:10"/> one;</hi> Jews and Gentiles, all are under Sin; there is no <hi>Pagan,</hi> but he approaches God with his Sacrifices and Prayers as an Offender; Propitiation, Pardon, Reconciliation, is that he looks after. Every one that has an Exerciſe of Conſcience, whoſe Heart is not entirely hardened, has this for his principal Care, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 2.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is the Summ of the Goſpel, the principal End of all Divine Revelation, to teach how this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this guilty Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, this Enemy, this Ungodly Man may be Juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. for theſe come all to one thing, How Saved? how Pardon'd? how Juſtified? how Reconcil'd? how Sanctifi'd? how in Covenant of Peace with God? how ſhall I eſcape Hell? how ſhall I enjoy Heaven? Chriſt is the one true and living way, Chriſt is the one Mediator, Chriſt is the Surety of the Covenant: We are Juſtified thorough the Redemption that is in Chriſt, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Object of the Goſpel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. This is the End of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. And this is the End of Ordinances, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is by Faith, and Faith by Hearing.</p>
            <p>A 5th. Help to render us ſtudious about it, is Satans Pains, and alas! his Succeſs too in either Corrupting it in our Thoughts, or keeping us from Thoughts of it: <hi>Satanae ſolamen (ſicut ſolamen miſerorum) eſt habere ſocios:</hi> A ring-leader of Rebels drew all to his Party he could or can, and all Mankind he has brought unto the ſame Condemnation with himſelf: But our God from his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Compaſſion to us poor miſerable Men who are deceiv'd by Satan, has invented this way of our Salvation thorough Chriſt, which is a Delivery from Satan's Tyranny into the ſweet Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſtian Liberty; this he endeavours to hinder by Blinding Mens Eyes, that they may miſtake it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, whoſe Minds the god of this World hath blinded:</hi> His Device among both <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> in the old World, was to truſt to their own Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that God in Mercy would accept the Blood of a Beaſt for the Life of a Man, or one Man for many. The <hi>Jews</hi> took the Ceremonial Law for a Remedying Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6, 7. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls it <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> that is none; and <hi>v.</hi> 4. tells what the Goſpel is: But all Sacrifices being laid down among the Chriſtians, after Chriſt's ſacrificing himſelf, Satan attempts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Methods. 1. The groſſeſt: That Chriſt dy'd only for an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50846:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> Example, and that his Self-denyal to Natural Inclinations might move us to be deny'd to our ſinfull; and that his Powerful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in his Father, and Prayer to him, inclines him to Pardon on eaſie Terms, ſo that now half-work may be taken for the whole. 2. Others, That Chriſt's Sacrifice did obtain a Pardon, but not for all kind of ſins; ſome for Original Sin only, ſome for ſins in Ignorance alſo; ſome for all ſins before Converſion, for others their own good Works, Merits, Penances, together with the Prieſtly Abſolution, muſt pay or appeaſe. A 3d. Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, That Chriſt Merited that we might Merit, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately we are accepted for our own Works, but remotely for Chriſts, for on his Account our own are acceptable. Chriſt has purchas'd a Covenant of Grace for all, which Promiſes Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, Helps of the Spirit, and a right to Heaven, under the eaſie Conditions of Faith and Repentance: by theſe a Man is juſt in reſpect of this Covenant that requires no more, and by this Juſtice and Righteouſneſs he is Juſtifi'd, but it is on the Account of Chriſt's Merits that this is reckon'd Righteouſneſs, and this Covenant or Law of Grace is given, that accepts ſuch imperfect Holineſs for Righteouſneſs. <q>This Righteouſneſs is Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſays <hi>Grotius, Luk.</hi> 17. becauſe it conſiſts in the Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Mind; the Obedience is due, but to do willingly Merits.</q> As to the Order of the Covenant, it Merits an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. By this Doctrine all are equally Juſtifiable by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, but all do not equally partake of Gifts to perform the Conditions: Nor is there any Promiſe of Ability to perform theſe Conditions, for then ſome of the Promiſes would be abſolute. Our Juſtification is by our own Works, but our Juſtification on ſuch Imperfect Works is of Chriſt, or we are oblig'd to Chriſt for this eaſie Law; but the Works of the Law are our own, and we muſt be try'd by them: And yet ſome Proteſtants ſay, this Evangelical Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires greater Perfection than the Law of Nature,<note place="margin">Bull. <hi>Examen.</hi> p. 173.</note> and that no other Law threatens Eternal Death, or Promiſes Eternal Life but it, and all ſince <hi>Adam</hi> are born under this Goſpel-Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone as to Eternal Concern. I think this deſerves the Title of <hi>Neonomianiſm,</hi> and juſtles both Chriſt and his Goſpel out of doors; for then there is no Pardon of Sin by Chriſt, for none can tranſgreſs the Law they were or are not under, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves Chriſt did not ſuffer for Sins againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50846:11"/> but they admit any Abſurdity for this Idol: It's now in Vogue, and puts on many various ſhapes; I could reckon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, but ſhall forbear the Schemes of them till afterwards: I mention them now only to ſhow Satan's Diligence in Obſcuring and Perplexing this Caſe, that is of greateſt Concern to our Souls of any in this World or the World to come; and ſhould not we be as diligent in Searching out and Contending for this Faith once deliver'd to the Saints, ſince it is a Title to ſo great an Eſtate, our Charter for Heaven? And yet for the weak Chriſtian's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort I muſt ſay, the Doctrine may be Fundamental that may have many Problematic Queſtions about it, that the Ignorance, Doubts or Errors in, will be but as the Stubble and Hay upon a good Foundation. Ill Management of our Plea at a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Grace will not make us loſe the Cauſe, when uttermoſt diligence is given. Once more under Correction, I believe that ſerious Chriſtian that holds Faith as the Inſtrument of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in his Profeſſion, and the other that earneſtly Contends it bears the room of a Condition, often have not the leaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their Idea's or Thoughts, when they plead their Cauſe in Prayer before God; yet when Miniſters inculcate in People's Ears, they may, yea ought to plead their good Works at the Day of Judgment, as lately has been, it will ſoon breed this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in Ignorant People's Minds, and they who are Teachers of others ought to be better inſtructed themſelves.</p>
            <p>A 6th. Help: Becauſe the Purity of this Doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from any Mixture of Man's Works or Merits with it, is the greateſt Bleſſing of the Reformation from Popery: In <hi>England</hi> the Diſcipline was very little altered, the Idolatry of Worſhipping of Saints fell as a Conſequent of this Doctrine, that aſcribes all Merit to Jeſus Chriſt. This Doctrine was the Everlaſting Goſpel Propheſy'd of <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6, 7. and was fulfill'd in the Preaching of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and they who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; they were the firſt of the Witneſſes or Proteſtants God illuminated with this Doctrine, and encourag'd them to bear their Teſtimony for it thorough all manner of Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For the Goſpel is the Doctrine of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, his Righteouſneſs is the Evangelical Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. c. 3.20, 21, 22. c. 9.31, 32. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 10.3. and the Righteouſneſs of Faith, or <hi>by</hi> it; it is the Teſt of a Proteſtant and <hi>Shibboleth</hi> of an Heretick: It is, ſays <hi>Luther, Articulus ſtantis aut cadentis
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50846:12"/> Eccleſiae;</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> before him, <hi>Eccleſia diſcernit juſtos ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtis non Lege Operum, ſed Lege Fidei:</hi> And there is great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, it has ſuch an Influence on all other Doctrinal and Practical Truths. The Deity of Chriſt, if not God, no Value in the Satisfaction: the Trinity, if no diſtinct Perſons, no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; Original Sin, for if all not lyable to Death, guilty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, no need of his Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no fear of relapſing into Popery by any Perſon on whoſe Heart this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is impreſs'd; but there is ground to fear that <hi>Luther</hi> was a true Prophet, who ſaid, <hi>Poſt mortem noſtram hac Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na rurſus obſcurabitur.</hi> As we would Value the faithfulneſs of our Anceſtors, who ſuffered Martyrdom for propagating this Doctrine to us, it is the moſt precious Inheritance we enjoy; as we would Value our own Souls, for there is no eſcaping Wrath if we neglect ſo great a Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. as we Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Sacred Revelations of God, for this is the Marrow of it, we would ſeriouſly ſet about this Study, How ſhall I be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified before God? What doth Chriſt's Righteouſneſs contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to a Sinner's Salvation? What Kindneſs has our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for poor Sinners?</p>
            <p>But I ſhall come to the Words, which contains theſe two things:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Explicatory Repitition of the former Propoſition, that <hi>Abraham</hi> found nothing as to the Fleſh; for <hi>if</hi> Abraham <hi>was juſtified by Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) An Argument for the Proof of it, becauſe <hi>he had nothing to Glory in before God.</hi> To begin with the firſt of theſe, though the Propoſition is Explicatory, yet ſuch is the Subtilty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his Diligence in filling the World with darkneſs of Error, and reflecting his black Clouds upon the Light of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Explication it ſelf needs a Comment, or rather a Defence: The (1.) Thing to be explain'd, is the Signification of the Word it ſelf, <hi>Juſtifie:</hi> Never was there Word of greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Concern; for Juſtification is the Soul of Religion, and Marrow of the Goſpel, without it nothing in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could Comfort a Sinner; never was Word matter of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Strife and Contention, and yet never leſs Reaſon for it; but the greatneſs of its influence for bringing Souls out of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Kingdom, makes it Satans principal Butt and Aim; the moſt of all other Diſputations of Religion end in Criticiſm,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50846:12"/> but this begins with it: The 1ſt. Queſtion is, between us and Papiſts, with whom the <hi>Swinckfeldians</hi> take part, that is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Word <hi>Juſtifie</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, eſpecially in this, when it treats of our Righteouſneſs, the Ground of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before the Tribunal of God, is to be taken in a Phyſical or a Forenſick Senſe? Whether for ſanctifying a Sinner and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an unjuſt Perſon juſt, or for a judicial Abſolving of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accuſed Perſon from the charge brought againſt him? The latter is the common Sence and <hi>Teſſera</hi> of a Proteſtant, and the former the <hi>Shiboleth</hi> of a Papiſt, excepting <hi>Grotius</hi> and his Followers; who in this, and worſe, take part with Papiſts. Therefore this ſhall be the firſt Aſſertion, That it is a Juſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not a Juſtification, of a Moral or Politick, and Relative, not an abſolute Nature.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Arg.</hi> Tho' the Word it ſelf is barbarous in the Latin Tongue, and made by Divines, for the moſt genuine near and faithful Tranſlation of the Original Text; yet the Latin will favour this Sence, for <hi>Juſtifica mens deorum. Catul:</hi> Signifies their juridical Diſtributions of Rewards and Puniſhments, and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Son is call'd <hi>juſtus filius,</hi> from <hi>Jus</hi> Right, and in Engliſh we uſe the Word <hi>Magnifie</hi> and <hi>Glorifie,</hi> not for making but eſteeming Great and Glorious. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> with all its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Daughters do far more Confirm this Sence, for one of their Conjugations uſually adds <hi>declaring</hi> to the Primitive Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Barar</hi> pure, in <hi>Arabick,</hi> the Conjugation <hi>Taphahalah</hi> makes it ſignifie, he <hi>clear'd himſelf,</hi> or juſtified himſelf juridically; in the <hi>Heb. Tame</hi> polluted, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.12. ſignifies to pronounce Unclean, which in this Word <hi>Zadak,</hi> to Juſtifie, holds almoſt always in all the ſix Oriental Languages, in <hi>Hiphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> as to the <hi>Greek</hi> we find it about thirty ſix or thirty eight times in the New Teſtament always in this Sence, declaring, eſteeming, or judging Juſt; the ſhorteſt Method of the Proof is by inſtances of theſe Texts, that the Papiſts plead for, and ſome Proteſtants are willing to yield; (that it often ſignifies Forenſically the Papiſt themſelves grant) the Principal place is <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. A Forenſick Juſtification is not capable of encreaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> (1.) In the Sence and Manifeſtation of it, it is. (2.) Where Courts are ſubordinate, it is; he that is juſtified in one, may go on to be juſtified in another. (3.) This Text ſpeaks only of the Continuation of it, and there is a conſiderable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50846:13"/> the firſt Sentence of Juſtification, and the Continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that State. (4.) Some Original Copies of conſiderable Authority, reads it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which removes all pretence. The next place to this in their Opinion is, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>And they that turn many to Righteouſneſs;</hi> the Original is, they that <hi>juſtifie</hi> many. <hi>Reſp.</hi> (1.) Preachers do as much Juſtifie, as they Sanctifie, their Inſtruction and Authority hath equal Influence on both: A third place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. The Objection may be thus obviated, Tho' <hi>ſanctifying</hi> and <hi>juſtifying</hi> be named together; yet they may be diſtinct Bleſſings, and not Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory one of another. (2.) Our Lord Jeſus is the Author of the One, and the Spirit of God the Author of the Other. (3.) The Bleſſed Spirit of God is alſo a Cauſe of Juſtification, in his working Faith and Sealing a Pardon; but for Scriptures that prove its Forenſick Sence, the Reader may look <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.4. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.31. <hi>Job</hi> 13.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.19. and 12.37. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29. and 10.29. and 16.15. and on this very Subject, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. and 8.33. which the Papiſts themſelves grant. Thus much for the firſt Argument, from the Etymology, and uſual Acceptation of the Word from Sacred Writ; to which may be added, the Teſtimony of Fathers and Prophane Authors; as <hi>Chryſ.</hi>

               </gap>, to Puniſh. (2.) Argument is from its contrary, the contrary of making juſt, is Sinning, or Tempting to Sin; but the Scripture ſhews us, that the contrary of <hi>juſtifie</hi> is to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, Deut.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4, 5. and 8.33. The uſual Signification, or Primitive Significations, to which all others are reducible, is the final reſult of a try'd Caſe, to acquit or condemn, treat as juſt or unjuſt, upon an Antecedent judicial Tryal: And Scripture uſes the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Signification to <hi>acquit;</hi> the prophane Authors the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to <hi>Puniſh</hi> or <hi>Condemn:</hi> from which we ſee no Word of the World ſo fit; for our Juſtification is not properly ſo, but a Pardon; it is an Acquitment upon a Suffering or Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given; Chriſt was properly juſtified, we properly pardon'd; but the nearneſs of Relation between Him and Believers, the Reflection or Rebound his Juſtification has on our Pardon, gives
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50846:13"/> it the Name. Chriſt was in ſome ſence, tho' different, both condemn'd and juſtifi'd; and ſo are we; this makes the Word which ſignifies both ſo proper; for our Juſtification is on a foregoing Condemnation. (3.) The Explicatory and Synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Expreſſions in Scripture, ſhews it to be taken in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſick Sence, as Remiſſion of Sin, Reconciliation with God, not coming into Condemnation: <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, for in thy ſight ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified.</hi> (4) The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it in Scripture, as the reſult of a judiciary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: we read of the Judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. (1.) <hi>Job</hi> 9.3. <hi>How ſhall Man be Juſt with God, if he will Contend with him</hi> (2.) A Judge, the Judge of all the Earth will do righteouſly. (3.) Of a Law. (4.)

There is a Tribunal of exact Juſtice, and a Throne of Grace as a Superiour Chancery. (9.) There is Faiths Pleading at the Barr of the one, and appealing from the other. (10.) Chriſt as an Advocate, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. (11.) His Righteouſneſs the Plea, and the Abſolving Sentence paſs'd upon that account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>To declare his Righteouſneſs, that he may be juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believes in Jeſus.</hi> (5.) I ſhall only explain that one <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free Gift came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men unto Juſtification of Life:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that one Chriſt, as the Matter or Merit of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is put in Oppoſition to the offence of that one <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Matter or Demerit of our Condemnation; ſo Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the abſolving Sentence is put in Oppoſition to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, for Holineſs or Righteouſneſs is not a proper op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Condemnation. The laborious <hi>Gerard</hi> does not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe ſay Sanctification is rather us'd for Juſtification, than Juſtification for it; for when the Prieſt did cleanſe the Leper, it was as much and more by Abſolving and pronouncing clean, than by any Phyſical Cure thoſe Ceremonies could make on that Diſtemper, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.14. to which the New Teſtament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which Will we are ſanctified, through the Offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> The immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Fruit of the Sacrifice was Atonement, Peace and Pardon, our Sanctification is the immediate Fruit of the Spirit. Thus much for the Signification of the Word, and general Nature of the thing.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:50846:14"/>
            <p>I ſhall next propoſe ſeveral Heads and Helps, for the more diſtinct Apprehenſion, and particular Knowledge of this great Miſtery. (1.) The Relation it ſtands in to the other Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Fruits of Chriſts Death. (2.) What is to be reckoned for the Abſolving Sentence. (3.) When it is, that the Sinner is Abſolved and Juſtified. I ſhall leave other Queſtions to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
               <hi>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are four great Priviledges and Fruits of Chriſts Death, that are of a Relative Nature and as many of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and Phyſical kind; for the firſt four, There is this Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Redemption, Reconciliation, and Adoption. (1.) For Redemption, it is taken two ways in Scripture: Either for the paying of the Price, or the Applicaion of the purchaſed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the Perſon.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Sence it is the Foundation of all the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, for it puts on the Nature of the Ranſom, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other Name it may put on, by which theſe Priviledges are conveyed in Juſtice to us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being Juſtified through the Redemption.</hi> Coloſ. 1.20. <hi>Having made Peace through the Blood of his Croſs.</hi> Gal. 4.5. <hi>To redeem, that we might receive the Adoption.</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity.</hi> Eph. 1.14. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the Redemption of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion.</hi> There Redemption is put for the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all theſe Priviledges, being the common Term the Scripture uſes to expreſs the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt by, in its uſe and ends; by that he ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, by that we were freed from Death and Hell; and this Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being laid, he became the Avenger of Blood as to Satan who had ſlain us, and recovered the Captives from that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Conqueror. (2.) Redemption, is put for the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Priviledge bought by this Price to the Perſon: As when a Slave in <hi>Algiers</hi> has not only attained Money to be paid to his Patron, but he himſelf is actually returned home; and therefore in Scripture it is ſeldom or ever uſed, for the Application of any one of the Priviledges apart, but for the compleat Conſummation of all of them in Glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. The day of Judgment is called the <hi>day of our Redemption,</hi> and alſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit, whereby you are ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the day of Redemption.</hi> Becauſe all the Priviledge purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that Price, doth not ſo much as commence till then;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50846:14"/> There is a beginning of Redemption from Guilt before in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and a Redemption from Enmity before in Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and from Sin before its Pollution and Dominion; but they are not compleated, nor a Glorification from Death and Mortality ſo much as begun. So much for the Relation between Juſtification and Redemption.</p>
            <p>The third Relative Priviledg is Reconciliation, and that is of two kinds too; either (1.) As it puts on the Nature and form of an Inward Affection: For we cannot conceive of God poſitively, but under ſome humane reſemblance; thus it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a reconcileableneſs, and belongs to the Love of good Will, a Willingneſs that mutal Communion and Fellowſhip ſhould be again renewed, and that diſtance, by which we are undone no more continue. Gods becoming our Councel from Eternity, ſome improperly calls this a Juſtification, but Council praecedes the Tryal, Juſtification follows; and his ſo early Intimations of his kind Purpoſes, and his giving his Son to be a Peace-Maker, tho' the pulling down of the Partition Wall coſt his Blood: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation taken thus, is the Foundation of Redemption, and all built upon it. Theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Love of God, and Gift of his Son, differ, as a Natural and Artificial Foundation; the natural Rock, and the firſt laid Stone, this Love and Reconcileableneſs is the very Nature of God, or an immediate reſult from it on the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſuch an Object; for God is Love, and Love made him communicate of the fulneſs of his Being to nothing, and he is a faithful Creator to protect and provide for what he brings forth, Love makes him ſo. (2.) Reconciliation is taken for the Agreement of Minds, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. <hi>Can two walk together, and not be agreed?</hi> Two Perſons who once were of one Mind, and of one Heart, they had the ſame deſigns, and ends mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engaged in Amity; and now this Temper and Condition after a miſerable miſunderſtanding is again renewed; as <hi>Davids</hi> bowels yearned after <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he was reconcileable, but Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was not renewed, until he had lived a conſiderable time in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> So <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Butler, when he is again reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his wonted Place: Thus Reconciliation is the very ſame with Juſtification. The divorced Woman is again reconciled to her Husband, in the ſame State of Fellowſhip through the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace that ſhe was before breach of the Covenant of Works; as Juſtification is a reſtoring a Man to his former
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50846:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> State before the Charge or Suſpition of guilt, ſo Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a reſtoring to that State we were in before Enmity; they have both the ſame bleſſed Author, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, they have both the ſame moving Cauſe, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Love, breaking forth in Grace and Mercy from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: God became Mans Council in this Trial, wherein he is juſtified, and that Council was a Council of Peace; they have the ſame meriting Foundation, Chriſts Redemption; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence both at one and the ſame time, Guilt and Enmity falls at once: The one Simile only helps to illuſtrate, wherein the other may become defective; for all the Tranſactions between Men and Men, have their Exceptions and Diſſimilitudes, when they are brought to repreſent the Caſe between God and us: The one repreſents the Caſe as friendly, made up without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law, the other repreſents a fair Trial; the one repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it as a private Caſe, the other repreſents it as a publick Crime pardoned, Authority being appeaſed by a Satisfaction: By the one Guilt is removed, by the other Enmity; the one teaches that the other is not to be wire-drawn, for finding of ſomething in it anſwerable to all the parts of the Simile.</p>
            <p>The fourth is Adoption, which is of the ſame Relative Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the former, and has the ſame Cauſes and Means of Conveyance, and commences at one and the ſame time; but yet ſeem to differ in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Adoption comprehends a greater Bleſſing, Juſtification gives Life, but Adoption gives an Inheritance; Juſtification makes us free Subjects, but Adoption makes us Sons; Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion puts us in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Condition, but Adoption gives a right to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Expectation; for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Marriage from its very Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeems to be a Type of our Communion and Fellowſhip with Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. <hi>They ſhall be one Fleſh. Eph.</hi> 5.32. it is ſaid to be a great Myſtery: <hi>Vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>T. Goodwin.</hi>

            <p n="2">(2.) Juſtification of a Sinner is a Sublapſarian Bleſſing, but Predeſtination to Adoption is an Antilapſarian Bleſſing, deſign'd for Man before he fell, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Juſtification is a Mean, Adoption is an End, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. <hi>That being Juſtified by his Grace we ſhould be made Heirs according to the Hope of Eternal Life;</hi> and ſo in this Chapter it is treated of from the 13th. Verſe, as poſteriour to Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Juſtification is a more immediate Effect of Chriſt's Death,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50846:15"/> Adoption more mediate; it is by Juſtification that the bleſſed Line of Divine deſigns that was broken by Sin, is again tyed. God deſigned a perpetual aſcending Line of Bleſſings to his Creatures, but from Sin to Juſtification is a Parentheſis in this Line: <hi>John</hi> 12.24. Chriſt compares himſelf to a <hi>Corn of Wheat</hi> that dyes, that it may bring forth fruit, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and was Anointed to the Office of a Mediator, that he might recover thoſe who were deſign'd his Fellows and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, from their Forfeiture of it and Unfitneſs for it: Hence it is call'd a <hi>Purchas'd Poſſeſſion,</hi> Eph. 1.14. by reaſon that is Purchas'd, without which we could not enjoy it. We can have no Priviledge without Life.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The one ſeems to require a more Noble and Heavenly Temper of Spirit correſpondent to it: Regeneration anſwers the one, but the Spirit of Adoption, which is a higher degree, anſwers the other. The Regenerate Man may be under a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage, but they who have received the <hi>Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are more free from that ſlaviſh Temper, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. their Deſires are fix'd upon and more proportion'd to their Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) The one is aſcribed more to the Death of Chriſt, the other to his Life: We are <hi>Juſtified by his Blood, Saved by his Life,</hi> Rom. 5.9. By Authority he <hi>forgives ſins,</hi> but by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion he prays for the <hi>Priviledges of Adoption.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dictinction there may be, there is no Separation, which is frequent among Men who have their Life often ſpar'd without reſtoring their Eſtates, and may forfeit the one ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) There is a Priority in Juſtification to Adoption, tho' not in Time, yet in Order of Nature, this follows conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from all the reſt, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. The right to Sonſhip fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Juſtifying Faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.7. being <hi>Heirs</hi> follows being <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> Rom. 8.17. We are firſt Children, then Heirs, and a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer and Divine Conduct for a Holy Life anſwers Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt Life, then Eſtate, in Order of Nature.</p>
            <p>The Arguments brought againſt it by the Learn'd <hi>Forbeſius,</hi> are anſwerable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Adopt is the Act of a Father, and the Acts of the Father in the Trinity are before the Acts of the Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. <hi>Reſp.</hi> That Order holds more in their Concurrence to one
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50846:16"/> Act than in diſtinct Acts, for Juſtification is the Act of the whole Trinity, ſo is Adoption. (2.) That Order holds more in Antelapſarian than Sublapſarian Actions; for in the latter, Redemption, which is Chriſt's Act, is firſt, for there Actions flow not from God immediately as God. The <hi>Second,</hi> What is firſt in Chriſt, is firſt in us, but Chriſt is a Son firſt, before Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as a Redeemer. <hi>Reſp.</hi> This is true in the Order of Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for we are firſt deſign'd Sons to be the Companions and Fellows of that only begotten, but 'tis not true in Order of Execution. (3.) We are Chriſts Brethren by Adoption. <hi>Reſp.</hi> He is a Brother by Incarnation, and fitted for being our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer by it. It is not our Brotherhood by Adoption fitted Chriſt for Redemption, but his becoming our Brother by Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The relation of the abſolute Bleſſings, Regeneration, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be underſtood by the following head.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Help for more diſtinct Knowledge of this Bleſſing, is what ſupplies the room or place of the Juſtificatory Sentence. By Virtue of what Act of God upon the Arraign'd Perſon doth he become formally free from the Curſe of the Law? By what doth he publickly manifeſt ſuch a particular Perſon pardon'd? <hi>Reſp.</hi> There are four apparent Competitors for this place: 1. The Voice of the Goſpel, declaring <hi>all that believe are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Act. 13.39. but the Voice of the Law and the Voice of the Judge are of diſtinct Natures. The Goſpel is in room of the Law, it's the Conſtitution of Chriſt's Kingdom, and it is alſo in room of the Records of a Court, it ſhews in general what is Conſtitutive of Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one ſhall many be made righteous;</hi> and is Deciſive of them that are Juſtified, or to be Juſtified, and them that are not or ſhall not be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath Life, and he that believeth not ſhall not ſee Life:</hi> But the Judg's part is to make an Authoritative Application of this Law or Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to an individual Perſon, this the Scripture doth not: All that Chriſt dy'd for are Juſtifiable by the Goſpel Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they often live a conſiderable time before they be actually Juſtified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but you are ſanctified, but you are juſtified.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxt. Confeſ.</hi> p. 40. There is a treble Pardon conſtitutive by God as a Law-giver, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative by God as a Judge, determining our Right, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in not inflicting the Poenalty: The Goſpel doth the firſt,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50846:16"/> the ſecond is that in queſtion. There are others, ſuch as the Teſtimony of the Spirit in a Perſon's own Conſcience, and the ſolemn Sentence at the Day of Judgment, which I referr to the ſeveral Courts our Cauſe is try'd in.</p>
            <p>That which I ſhall conclude on, as bearing nigheſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to it, is God's Act of Regeneration, his firſt Gift of Saving Faith and Sanctifying Grace, that beſide its abſolute Nature in Conforming the Soul to Chriſt, and raiſing his Image in it, it has a relative ſignification of Divine Favour, that is better than Life. God by that Deed or ſpeaking Action ſays, All thy ſins are blotted out, thy Iniqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies forgiven, thou art a Freeman in the State. (1.) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty,</hi> Rom. 6.7. <hi>He that is dead is freed</hi> (Orig. <hi>juſtifi'd) from ſin.</hi> (2.) As ſoon as ever man ſinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. he became guilty, and as ſoon as guilty the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpiritual Death followed; ſo if as ſoon as ſinn'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, as ſoon as Chriſt's Righteouſneſs applyed he is juſtifi'd; the receiving ſuch a bleſſed Fruit of it as the Spirit, is a ſure Application of it; there is as preſent and effectual Vertue in the Medicinal Potion for Life, as there was in the Poyſon to Death. (3.) <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. The Spirit of the Lord is an <hi>Earneſt of the Inheritance</hi> wherever he is; and ſince he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures Adoption, much more he enſures Juſtfication. (4.) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation makes us Sons, and the Priviledge of a Son is more than that of a Subject. (5.) <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10, 11. Whenever we are <hi>reconciled,</hi> we are <hi>juſtifi'd,</hi> for they are but different repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the ſame Priviledge, and Sanctification takes away the Enmity. (6.) When the Spirit is given to us, we receive a great Truſt, many Talents, and called to a great Office in Chriſts Kingdom, to praiſe and glorifie him, to propagate his Kingdom, <hi>created unto</hi> all <hi>good Works.</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and with him all Lawyers, judg'd his being put in a place of Office and Truſt, did virtually contain a Pardon in it. It implies much weakneſs in Government or Governours, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Traytors, Rebels and Criminals in places of Truſt, who muſt ſtrive for their Lives to hinder the juſt adminiſtration of the Government which would take away their own Life. (7.) <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.2. When Chriſt the Judge of the World verbally pronounces Forgiveneſs, he ſignifies all imports one thing; <hi>Ariſe and walk: Eyes be ye open: Be thou healed:</hi> Or, <hi>Thy ſins
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50846:17"/> be forgiven thee:</hi> His gifts are in a comprehenſive Cluſter; there is a ſtrong Chain of connexion among them, and he may name what is moſt eaſie; hence are they ſo united and involved into one another by Scripture, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. And (8.) There is not only the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſts Juſtifying, but the Example of his being juſtify'd, <hi>Who was juſtified in the Spirit,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. All the Works of the Spirit on him and by him were God's juſtifying him: His Reſurrection was his declared Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. It was the Pattern of ours, beſides other great Influences on ours: By it was he taken from the Priſon of the Grave, and acquitted from the Judgment, where try'd, therefore our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. is call'd <hi>Juſtification.</hi> (9.) Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cuſtom ſhews that Authority did intimate their Sentence by ſymbolical Actions, and things as well as words. <hi>Ovid. Albis atriſque Lapillis.</hi> The White Stone was ſent as a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol of Abſolution to the Perſon whoſe Name they wrote upon it. <hi>Pierius</hi> in his <hi>Egyptian</hi> Hierogliphicks gives this Account of the Rights of a Slaves Manumiſſion: That he was Cloath'd in White Raiment, and his Patron's Ring put upon his Finger, and did eat at his Maſter's Table. The Scripture makes uſe of all theſe as Symbols of our Freedom from the Bondage of Corruption and Servitude of Sin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. The <hi>Ring</hi> is made mention of <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.8. there's the <hi>White Raiment,</hi> Rev. 2.17. there's the <hi>Manna,</hi> the Food of our Lord's Table, and the <hi>White Stone</hi> with our Names upon it. This expreſſing of a Sentence by an Action, is becoming of the Divine Majeſty, with whom to <hi>do</hi> and to <hi>ſay</hi> are the ſame; his great Work of Creation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd no more to its production but God's ſaying, <hi>Let there be a Light, a Firmament,</hi> &amp;c. and it was ſo. This great Work of Regeneration, it's a <hi>begetting by his Word:</hi> Hoſ. 2.14. A <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Comfortably</hi> to the Heart, and frequently a Calling, <hi>Whom he Call'd he Juſtified;</hi> his Vocation put them in a Juſtified State. (10.) Sanctification or Regeneration removes a Puniſhment as well as a Crime; the giving of a ſpiritual Life takes away a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Death, which is the worſt of Puniſhments: The Deſertion by the Spirit is the greateſt Curſe, and that is removed by the Gift of the Spirit, and what takes away the Puniſhment does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily remove the Guilt, or ſuppoſe it remov'd; for the greater Mercy does comprehend the leſſer. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> From the Nature
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50846:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>By his Knowledge ſhall my righteous Servant juſtifie many;</hi> it may either be by the <hi>Gift</hi> of Knowledge, or by the <hi>Act</hi> of Knowledge upon him; for <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> it is no ſooner in being than it is in exerciſe. The Seed of Grace is not like Material Seed, to need a Time of Corruption and intermixture with the Earth before it grow, but like the Beams of the Sun that act as they are received. The Gift of Faith is the Idea of Heavenly things ſuggeſted into the Soul, and there manifeſting themſelves by their own Light; ſo that we are Receivers of the Objects of Faith when we act Faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24. <hi>Before they call I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking I will hear:</hi> Hence Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration's being the Sentence does not pecede the Exerciſe of Faith as a Mean: This might afford more Arguments for this Truth, becauſe then the Union between us Debtors and Chriſt as Surety, is Compleated, which is not 'till we apprehend him by Faith. (2.) Then the Soul actually Pleads, and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore it's Term-time, the <hi>acceptable Day</hi> of our Salvation; the Court ſits on our Caſe, and all the Cauſes of our Salvation are Cloath'd with a forenſical Form from this Exerciſe of Faith, by which we look on God as our Judge, on Chriſt's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs as our Plea, on Satan as our Accuſer, on Chriſt as our Advocate, and his Spirit our Council; on the Law as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment drawn up againſt us, and on its Conſtitution and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice as a Tribunal, from which we Appeal to the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> of the Goſpel, founded on Goodneſs and Equity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> There are ſome Objections againſt this Doctrine: (1.) Sanctification is a gradual thing, Juſtification is one Act. (2.) That this would Confirm the Popiſh Error, that Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a forenſical or relative Act, but a Phyſical and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute one.</p>
            <p>To both which I Anſwer: (1.) That the Sentence of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not Juſtification, but the Declaration of it, and the Gift of the Spirit for Sanctification the Sign of that. Faith is an Abſolute Act, by which we are juſtified, but Juſtification is the relative Reſult of all the Cauſes and Foundations. Fatherhood or Sonſhip are Relative things, but to be Born, or to be Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, is an abſolute thing. (2.) In all Similitudes there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Unlikeneſs, and ſo in this: For, 1. He who is Judge, is both Law-giver and ſupream Governour too; in other Caſes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50846:18"/> in this. 2. In others we have done with the Judge when the Sentence is paſt, but not in this. (2.) In others we need but one Act, becauſe we can abſtain from the like Crimes; but in this we need a Continual Juſtification or Remiſſion: Hence we daily Pray, <hi>Forgive us our Sins;</hi> and we have daily Encouragement, that <hi>if any Man ſin</hi> there is <hi>an Advocate with the Father:</hi> The Court conſtantly ſits, we are always on our Knees before the Bar, our Faith perpetually Pleads, and Chriſt's always interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and he is always heard; hence a conſtant continued Stream of Juſtification, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9. call'd <hi>Forgiveneſſes;</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.9. the <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> or <hi>Juſtifications,</hi> for it is the ſame word; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. is tranſlated <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and thus may be expounded, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He that is</hi> Juſtified, <hi>let him be</hi> Juſtified <hi>ſtill;</hi> and in this very Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Juſtified by Acts of Faith</hi> ſeveral Years after his firſt Converſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6. it was at leaſt Ten Years after his firſt Faith. Our Caſe is a continued State of Juſtifying or Pardoning.</p>
            <p>That which recommends this Opinion to me, is not only its Appearance of Truth, but its Medicinalneſs for Reconciling the different Opinions of Perſons ſo lately on foot; for the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers Apology grants, 1. That Faith and Repentance are abſolutely given to the Ungodly, for what is Man elſe before that Gift? 2. That Faith and Repentance are only given to the Elect. Are they not then, 1. The Gifts, Bleſſings, Tokens of ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Symbols of divine diſtinguiſhing Love, though they may be long unintelligible to the Perſon under the Exerciſe of them, as the Inſcription of <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> on the Wall was to the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> yet <hi>ex Natura rei &amp; intentione Authoris,</hi> it imports a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's being Reconcil'd to God, Fellowſhip with Heaven is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and two cannot walk together and not be agreed. Effects alway ſignifie their Cauſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. 2. Can a Perſon be under ſpecial Favour, and not Pardon'd, or Reconcil'd and not Pardon'd? Call'd and not Juſtifi'd? not under Wrath and yet under Guilt, or elſe under Divine Love and Wrath at once? or that the Puniſhment, to wit, want of the Spirit, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Death, is remov'd, and not the Guilt or lyableneſs to the Puniſhment, although ſo remov'd as eventually never to return again from the Vigour of Divine Love fix'd on that Perſon: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. the Apoſtle deſcribes a State of Grace and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50846:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> as neceſſarily united: But I need not inferr this from them, ſince the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxt. Conf.</hi> p. 40. ſaith, <q>To Sanctifie is to Pardon, that is, executively, becauſe it takes away the greateſt Puniſhment, Spiritual Death; and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Pardon muſt go before the Execution. And (fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) our Pardon is ſubſervient to our Renovation, by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as imperfectly now begun; for being imperfect the Defect of every Act deſerves Condemnation, and needs Pardon, and yet this Pardon is a particular Pardon following the general Pardon of our Perſons, by which we eſcape Wrath, and are capable of Acceptable Obedience for the future.</q> By this the Pardon of our Perſons ſhould precede every Act of Faith and Repentance, for a following particular Pardon accompanies every Act of them.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt difficulty is, how Faith and Repentance ſhould bear both the Place of a Sentence and a Condition, which is needfull to reconcile theſe two Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. By Condition they mean not a Condition properly in a Law or a foederal Sence, as we uſe the Word in Bargains between Man and Man; for the <hi>Civilians</hi> inform me theſe three Properties make a Condition: 1. Poteſtative, that it be in the Parties Power to perform. 2. Caſualty in it ſelf, and to the other Party uncertain. 3. Cauſal, in that it bear a Valuable Conſideration. The Law will not ſuffer a Man to injure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far, or another to deceive him, as to get a Title to an Eſtate of two or three hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> for an hundred Guineas: But the <hi>Apol.</hi> informs us, that <q>This Condion is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our Power, 2. Nor Uncertain, 3. Nor Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, therefore not a Condition properly. Nay, further, (tho' the Goſpel be a Law, and this Law is the Condition of the Covenant) yet it is not a Legal Condition:</q> Therefore it muſt be in a Phyſical or Logical Sence, if not in a Law Sence; and a Neceſſary Connection is enough for the one, <hi>viz.</hi> Logical, as if a Man be Reaſonable, he is capable of Learning, and if capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Learning, he is reaſonable; and Priority enough for the other, as that Wood muſt be laid to the Fire before it can be burnt. And this Opinion is very agreeable with Condition in this Sence, for there is not only a Neceſſary Connexion between Faith, Repentance and Juſtification, but there is a Priority, (the Covenant of Grace partakes more of Orderlineſs, it is Order'd
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50846:19"/> in all things, than of Conditionalneſs) for the Foundation is before the Relation, the Sign before the Signification, the Gift of Faith and Repentance is before its Connotation of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or being receiv'd into Favour. Nay, further, there is not only the Gift of Faith, but the exerciſe of this Grace as mix'd with our Faculties, and become a Duty in order of Nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to this Connotation or Signification of our being now brought under Divine Favour; becauſe the way of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating this Gift is by Calling, ſpeaking immediately to the Soul, and repreſenting ſpiritual Ideas, making us behold as in a Glaſs the glorious Image of the Lord, diſcovering unſeen and hoped for things, as before and after both is further explained; and the Gift cannot be without this exerciſe, by which God and the Soul unite and mutually apprehend one another. In ſhort thus: That this Gift may not only be long unperceiv'd by the Receiver, but that it cannot Signifie untill in Exerciſe, tho' as a Gift it doth ſignifie.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more, that Juſtification and Glory are ſuſpended upon theſe Duties of Faith and Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> Either by Suſpenſion he means no more but Neceſſary Conſequential; ſo we Agree, and I do not find his Arguments will prove more: For a Teſtament is fully as proper a Title, that gives Name to the whole Bible, as Covenant or Bargain; and Civilians ſay, the <hi>If</hi> uſed in Teſtaments, which is ſo frequent in Scriptures, is a demonſtrative <hi>If,</hi> that doth not Suſpend but Deſign the thing Promiſed, and ſome certain Time or Manner of Conveyance. If he underſtand it a Legal Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it's the ſame with a Legal Condition, which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd before; for, <hi>Conditio eſt diſpoſitionis ſuſpenſio ex eventu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certo ei oppoſito,</hi> and has an Obliging Influence on the Promiſer, and Conferrs a Title of Right to the Benefit promiſed.</p>
            <p>I might Conclude this with ſome Teſtimonies out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but though I find Phraſes to anſwer my Purpoſe, I find the Style ſometimes Looſe and Oratorical, and ſometimes they Deſign another thing (which I wiſh a late Author had mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who Attempts to prove the New Law out of the Fathers, when <hi>Daille</hi> who was better acquainted with them, ſays, It's in vain to make them Judges in many of the Controverſies between us and the Papiſts; and yet this Authour would bring them to Prove a more Nice Point, become a very late Queſtion. In
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50846:19"/> what ſenſe the Law is New thoro the Goſpel, or the Goſpel may be call'd a Law, I ſhall only inſtance his firſt Citation out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> p. 228. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I am willing to be judged by any of the Subſcribers that will take the Pains to read it, if <hi>Juſtin</hi> intends any thng more than the recommending the Chriſtian Conſtitution, and proving it preferable to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical: For he ſays, This New Law is Poſterior to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, but the Apologiſt's New Law has been ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> He ſays this New Law is Chriſt and his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Any may ſee he took Law in no ſtrict Senſe, when he calls Chriſt and his Teſtament a Law; he calls it a Teſtament Eight times in that Page, and nigh Seventy times in that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and ſeldom, I think not above Four times, a Law, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Explicatory word Teſtament added;) yet I think this Opinion will help to wreſt the Fathers out of the Papiſts Hands. The Fathers uſe the Words <hi>Juſtifie</hi> and <hi>Sanctifie</hi> often promiſcuouſly, for making Juſt and Holy. The common An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by Proteſtants is, the Fathers uſe the Word according to its Grammatical Signification, not Forenſical Uſe: To which the Papiſts anſwer, Then they were not acquainted with that ſenſe. This affords another, for we may ſay, <hi>to Sanctifie</hi> is <hi>to Juſtifie,</hi> in the ſame Senſe that Chriſt ſays, <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> that is, a Sign of it: And ſo we may underſtand the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Eſt,</hi> or Is, Metonymically, for <hi>eſt Signum;</hi> and we may find enough among their Writings to ſhew that all the Parts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Sanctification are Signs of Juſtification; which doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſhew, that tho' this Phraſe is New, that the Gift of the Holy Spirit in order to our Sanctification, ſtands in the room and place of a Juſtificatory Sentence, yet the Senſe is not; for it is the Sign, yea the ſpiritual Initiating Sign of our being in Covenant with God: <hi>This is the Covenant I will make with them, I will pour out my Spirit on them.</hi> Being in Covenant is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Bleſſing as well as Juſtification, and they are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Now, ſays the Lord, my giving my Spirit imports this, I take thee to be one of my People, I avouch thee this Day to be mine. The Prince's Proclamation of Pardon to a Rebel, or the Judges Juſtificatory Sentence of a Perſon ſuſpected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, impriſon'd, is the firſt Authoritative Signification of the Governments Favour: So what is the firſt Sign of Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour muſt ſtand in the place of a Juſtifying or Pardoning Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50846:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> but theſe abſolute Bleſſings that are proper to the Elect, of Faith and Repentance, are the firſt Intimations of Divine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments receiving us into Favour, therefore the Gift of them is the Abſolving Sentence.</p>
            <p>A third Propos'd Head, was the Time of our Juſtification, which being meant of the firſt Act, neceſſarily follows from the former Propoſition, to be neither later nor ſooner than the firſt Moment of our Converſion. The Goodneſs of God would not ſuffer our Juſtification to be ſooner, for he would not keep us out of Poſſeſſion of what is our Right; if as a juſt Judge he Juſtified us, as a Merciful Governour he would Treat us as ſuch, and let us have the Common Priviledge of Free Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which is his Spirit: Not the later, for his Juſtice could not give to a condemned Criminal without the Imputation of Mediatorial Satisfaction, the greateſt of the Favours and beſt of the Bleſſings of his Kingdom; but whatever Arguments proved the former Propoſition, proves this: As for the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian</hi> Notion of Juſtification from Eternity, it ſeems more abſurd than the Eternity of the World.</p>
            <p>There is a Threefold Uſe this Doctrine affords, of Tryal to the Doubtfull, of Support to the Dejected, and of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Carnal ſecure Perſon. As to the Firſt, Whatever doth prove the Sincerity of a mans Faith, the Reality of his Regeneration, may be to him a ſure Index and Token of his Pardon, ſince Regeneration it ſelf is the Juſtificatory Sentence. As to the Second, Whether the dejection or deſpair of Mind ariſe from the greatneſs of Sin, the Violence of Temptations, the ſtrength of Luſt, the multitude of Backſlidings, or long continuance in that comfortleſs State, or from ſuch ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Doctrines as the Fewneſs of the Choſen, and fixedneſs of the Number of them for whom Chriſt died; yet this one thing may ſupport the Soul, and fill it with the Joy of a pardon'd Criminal, that if there be the leaſt dram of Grace, though <hi>ſmall as a Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> Mat. 17.20. thy State is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, whatever come of others, or however uneaſie our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Condition be. For the Third, It is a vain thing for that man to live in Hopes, and truſt in Gods Mercy and Chriſts Satisfaction, without any inward Change in the Temper of his Mind; for the Sentence of Juſtification is never paſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him untill he be Regenerate: Thus the Apoſtle argues,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50846:20"/> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. obviating that Objection, <hi>If Grace be glorified in the Pardon of Sin, let us continue in ſin that Grace may abound.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? He that is dead, is</hi> juſtified <hi>from ſin:</hi> Theſe two are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable, a Juſtification from the Guilt of ſin, and a Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the Power and Pollution of ſin.</p>
            <p>I come now to the other Term of the Propoſition, <hi>Works,</hi> which I ſhall firſt Explain by ſeveral diſtinguiſhing Characters, and then ſecondly, come to the Propoſition, and ſhew in what ſenſe the one is deny'd: Of the other, how far Works are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Juſtification. For the firſt, 1. They are Good Works; neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor Gentiles ever pretended that God would juſtifie us for bad Works, that the ſame ſhould be matter of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Juſtification, that what needs a Pardon ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a pardon. 2. Not meerly Good in Mens Opinions; the <hi>Phariſees</hi> thought their Works better than they were, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. they did highly eſteem what God did abominate, and juſtified themſelves for it: for <hi>Paul</hi> might then, and ſhould have brought Arguments to prove they would be Condemn'd for their Works: And 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, would have Corrected their Error as Chriſt did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. by ſhewing their Works were not good, they came not up to the Extent and Spirituality of the Law. 3. The Apoſtle argues againſt the Works of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and the Law it ſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 27. and 4.13. not againſt a miſinterpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law. Chriſt calls that <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>ſaid of old,</hi> and <hi>ſaid of them,</hi> the Opinion and Tradition of Rabbins, not the Law, and Works of the Law. It's a ſandy Foundation which ſome lay for their Comments, Syſtems and Sermons, that only the works here meant are Moſaical in the Phariſaical ſenſe of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one word of proof for it; for then the fault or defect would be in the Law, not in the Works by the Law, for this Law ſay ſome of them had only Temporal Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 3. All Humane Actions, works in general, not as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> only External Works; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Followers diſtinguiſh between <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Works and Actions. But Divinity that has only the Morality of Actions for its formal Object, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exclude Internal, where all Morality lyes. The Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal works of the Apoſtles are call'd <gap reason="foreign">

(4.) Good Works are the Fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Good Works are wrought by a Righteous Man. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. <hi>A good Tree can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth evil Fruit, neither,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. The Apoſtle proves that we are <hi>ſaved not of Works,</hi> becauſe Good Works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our being God's Workmanſhip. (6.) Good Works muſt be according to Divine Command, for that is the Rule and Standard between Good and Bad, as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.4. is the formal Nature of Sin, ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the formal Nature of Good Works: <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. Good Works are call'd <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to the Law, that is the meaſure of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors right to his Creatures, and of the fellow Creatures to one another. Hence we are always ſent <hi>to the Law,</hi> and <hi>to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> if not according to theſe, there is neither <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in them. <hi>Johannes Agricola,</hi> the Ring-leader of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,</hi> is uſually condemn'd amongſt Divines, and its ſaid, was Converted by <hi>Luther</hi> from this Error: That Repentance was taught by the Goſpel, and not by the Law; for the Law is the Rule of all Obedience, the Goſpel is a Doctrine of Joy: <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. A <hi>word of Grace,</hi> Acts 20.29. becauſe it brings the tydings of pardon to guilty Perſons. The Law teaches <hi>Man's</hi> Righteouſneſs, but the Goſpel teaches <hi>God's</hi> Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17.3.21. And hence our State being mixed of Law and Goſpel, no Works are truly good and acceptable to God by the Law alone: Not from a defect in the Law, but a defect in us that cannot fulfill it. Hence (7.) No work is good without <hi>Faith, Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. laſt. There is ſome deformity in every action by reaſon of ſome defect or want of its Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Law. And (8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Its action needs a Pardon as well as every Perſon; and therefore are only acceptable in the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The doing in <hi>Faith,</hi> and the doing in <hi>his Name,</hi> are all One: ſo 'tis a Juſtifying Faith that's needed to juſtifie every action, and this Compoſition makes the Actions truly good, and as acceptable to God as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50846:21"/> thoſe that were no ways deficient either in Matter or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The Uſe I ſhall make of this, is of <hi>Refutation;</hi> for ſince none can pretend to be juſtified by any Works but ſuch as are good and acceptable in the ſight of God, and none are ſuch that want the foremention'd Qualifications, all the diſtinctions of Adverſaries about the Kinds of Works, are to no purpoſe. That this may be more evident, I ſhall rank them under theſe four Kinds.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who ſay that the Apoſtle means Works in their Perfection, that are excluded from a divine condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to our Impotency; he will not require what we cannot perform, but will juſtifie us for what we can. <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. If we did and always had perfectly fulfill'd the Law, we ſhould have been juſtifi'd by its Works: <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>The doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified:</hi> 2 Tit. 3.7. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done.</hi> 2. It would heinouſly reflect on the Holineſs of God as a Law-giver or Judge, to make an Imperfect Law, or to Judge a Man juſt for Imperfect Performance of a Perfect Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Second Opinion is of them who exclude the Moſaical Law; and theſe of two, and may be more ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some exclude only Ceremonies, and indeed the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie began about them, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. the Inſtances by <hi>Paul</hi> moſt mention'd are of that kind, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14, 16. and by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a Remedying Nature, the <hi>Jews</hi> miſtook them for the thing it ſelf: Thus <hi>Lombard</hi> and the Schoolmen, <hi>Alphonſ. a Caſt. Dom. a Soto.</hi> But the Law the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, as the Rule of the Works he excludes, cannot be Confin'd ſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. it's a Law that the Gentiles had; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 28. a Law that bound all Fleſh, a Law by which the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 4.14. a Law that <hi>worketh Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By others the whole Works of the Moſaical Law are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Phariſaical Senſe of them, that is, as ſeparated from the Eſſential Duties of the Covenant as given to <hi>Adam, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham. Reſpon.</hi> (1.) I grant that the Phariſees did miſtake the Law in its Extent and Intent too; the former Chriſt corrects, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. but it's very reaſonable to think that they who had now embraced Chriſt, to whom the Apoſtle
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50846:22"/> writes, had forſaken that Error; for the Apoſtle's Diſpute is of another kind; not what was their Duty or Work, but what place this Work or Duty had with reſpect to its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Whether or not it was truly Meriting; and his Buſineſs is to prove, that let their Works be what they would, they could never ſerve for this Uſe; and the Apoſtle tells them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4, 5. that they did not know Chriſt compleatly, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was <hi>the End of the Law,</hi> who would put ſuch a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue on their own Works. Sir <hi>Nor. Knat.</hi> Obſerves on <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Work of the Law,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Office of the Law;</hi> this was to Convince a Man of Sin, that he might fly to Chriſt, as <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 'tis called <hi>a School-maſter to bring us to Chriſt:</hi> The Law is the Mean, He is the End. The Moral Law was a Mean to make them ſenſible of their Need of Chriſt, and the Ceremonial was a Mean to repreſent him as the End of the other, as One who was a Sacrifice, and gave ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for their Breach of the Law. (2.) The Apoſtle gives no Countenance to this Opinion in his Phraſe; for <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given,</hi> &amp;c. There is an Impoſſibility in any Law, or its Works preſcribed to <hi>Adam, Noah</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſince Man was a Sinner, to Merit in any ſenſe Juſtification at the Hand of God. (3.) <hi>Romans</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. The Apoſtle calls the Works he excludes, <hi>Works of the Law;</hi> not in any abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe, but Works that the Law required; and the Moſaical Law comprehended all the former Laws under it, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.32. <hi>Ye received Circumciſion of Moſes, not that it was of him, but of the Fathers:</hi> And when the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſaical and the Chriſtian Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are oppoſed, Moſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ical comprehends the whole Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment State. (4.) The Righteouſneſſes that are in this Epiſtle oppoſed, are God's and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n's; not <hi>Adam</hi>'s eſſential Duties in the firſt Edition of the Naked Covenant, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his in the Political Adminiſtration of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. The <hi>Syriac</hi> renders it thus, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God by the hand of Faith on that Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Not a Righteouſneſs that is God's Gift, and is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God by Virtue of his preſcribing it as the Condition he required; a Righteouſneſs that lay in the Fruits of Faith, or in the Nature of Faith, from its Conformity to the Law of the Covenant, but a Righteouſneſs that Faith as a Hand takes hold of. (5.) This Law the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, comprehends all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Obedience, all Righteouſneſs: <hi>Vid.</hi> Ch. 3. and 7. of this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50846:22"/> Epiſtle; nay, the Phariſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. did conclude Love to God to be the great Duty of the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Opinion is of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who if the Writings that go under his Name, and have ſo much Corrupted the Age, be his own, he was both a Papiſt and Apoſtate; or if Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s <hi>Grotian Errors,</hi> and that other Book called <hi>Grotius Papizans,</hi> or <hi>Walleus in N. T. Preface,</hi> be to be Credited; indeed his Doctrine on this very Point of Juſtification is a very great Proof it, as his Comments on the Epiſtles doth teſtifie, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this: for tho' they are as Corrupt as he in their Diſputes, yet rarely in their Expoſitions, are any Papiſts ſo Corrupt: His Doctrine is thus, 1. Works that are only External, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, deſerving Praiſe of Men, and by Humane Strength per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, are excluded from an Intereſt in Juſtification. 2. Faith of God, is an Eſteem of his Attributes, and Faith of Chriſt is the Knowledge of him and his Doctrine. 3. To <hi>Juſtifie</hi> is to Purifie, to Cleanſe from Vice; ſo the Works are hypocritical, the Faith hiſtorical, and that which Devils has, the Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on papiſtical. <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. It's very improbable that the Apoſtle ſhould Diſpute ſo Nervouſly, that a Man cannot be Internally Sanctified by External Works; and as improbable that any ſhould be ſo abſurd to maintain it, that a Man may become Juſt by Hypocritical Performances, that external Civility is internal Holineſs. 2. That Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 14. requir'd more than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Works. 3. <hi>Abraham</hi> had better Works than External, and <hi>Paul</hi> when he <hi>knew nothing</hi> by himſelf, yet <hi>not thereby Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> did not mean only External. 4. They were what Works the Law requir'd, and the God that ſearcheth Hearts nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r made a meer External Law to Judge Men by.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth Opinion is that which is common among <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts;</hi> 1. Works before Faith are excluded, but not after Faith: Sorrow for Sin without the Aids of Grace, doth not Merit: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Works to Grace doth not Merit; though ſome, and that generally, allow a Congruity and Fitneſs to them; others, as <hi>Becanus,</hi> deny it: This is no more true than the others, for <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Abraham</hi> had Believ'd for Ten Years, and yet his Works not Imputed to him; and ſo <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. 2. If Works after Faith be moſt Meritorious, then there is moſt Matter of Boaſting from them; but <hi>Abraham</hi> had none to boaſt of, therefore none that could Merit. 3. The Works
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50846:23"/> of Believers, 1. Are Due. 2. Not our own. 3. Imperfect, therefore cannot Merit. But tho' there are different Opinions about what Works are excluded, there is an Agreement about what Works are included: Faith as a Work, as the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Conſent, pregnant of all the Duties of Marriage. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is included, Sincere Obedience is included, which I ſhall endeavour to refute on the fourth Verſe.</p>
            <p>The Second thing propoſed, was, In what Senſe they are Excluded. I ſhall Treat this, 1. Poſitively. 2. Comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 3. Give Account of the different Notions and Reſpects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which others think they may be Included.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, the Text excludes them indefinitely, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects that may be brought under the Particles <hi>with, of</hi> or <hi>by;</hi> for <hi>not by Works, without works,</hi> are the Apoſtle's Terms: For tho' Works are the Effects, Evidences, Concomitants, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our Juſtification, yet Juſtification is not <hi>by</hi> them; for <hi>by</hi> denotes ſome Cauſal Influence, either by Efficacy or Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Works have no ſuch Influence on our Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Comparatively, they are more excluded from our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here on Earth before God, than at the great Day of Judgment. Works have a leſs Influence on our being Called and Entered a Member of the Church Militant here below, than on our Entering the Triumphant State in Heaven; for the former is meerly a Matter of Right, and our Works have neither Being nor Dignity for that End; but the latter is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Poſſeſſion, and many things are requiſite to Poſſeſſion that are not to Purchaſe. Our Juſtification at the Great Day requires Proof of our being Juſtified here; and many things are Neceſſary to the Proof of Juſtification, that are not Neceſſary to the firſt being of it: Yet I much doubt any formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the bare appearance of the Perſons in Sanctity and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is evidence enough. (1.) In Order to our going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beſides the Neceſſity of Precept, Gratitude. For, Right good Works are real Means of Order, Preparation of our ſelves, and helping of others thither. (2.) Good Works have a real Efficacy in them, as all Actions have to beget and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then a Habit. (3.) Good Works have a real Congruity in them, to make us meet and fit for that Holy Fellowſhip and Communion above. (4.) Good Works are the Neceſſary Effects of Juſtification and Sanctification; the Spirit of God cannot
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50846:23"/> dwell in a Soul without transforming it more and more into a Likeneſs to Chriſt. (5.) Good Works have a real Utility in 'em, for heightning our Reward in Heaven: Not that they can from their own dignity Merit Degrees of Happineſs, more than the Being of Happineſs; but from the beautiful and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Order of Divine Providence, in advancing us from one ſtep to another, and not Conferring Degrees <hi>per ſaltum;</hi> there is no End of the Encreaſe of Chriſt's Kingdom, as to its Bleſſings; but its Encreaſe is by way of a Life, in a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and gradual Growth. (6.) Heaven is truly a Reward to our Holineſs here, by Virtue of Divine Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion from Divine Condeſcendency, as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſays; <hi>Manet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies ſempiterna non tanquam debitum operibus redditum, ſed ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum munificentiſſimi Dei gratiam. Hyſichius.</hi> The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not the Reward of Works, but is the prepared Grace of God: And as another ſays, It's propoſed as a Reward more to attract us to Duty, than a due Debt of our Duty; and it is rather the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by which all our Actions are rendered acceptable, that is Rewarded, than our Actions themſelves. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Our good Works are Neceſſary to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the Beginning and Growth of a thing is Neceſſary to its Perfection; as Sowing in the Spring is Neceſſary to Reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Harveſt, and our being Children in Order to our being Men. Perfect Holineſs is as much the Condition of Heaven as Faith is of Juſtification, and Ordinances of Converſion, and rather more; for there are Exceptions in the laſt, but none in the firſt.</p>
            <p>The Third thing propoſed, was the ſeveral reſpects, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons plead Works to be neceſſary, in Order to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and herein there is a greater Variety of Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> A Tenor or Hold, a Plea, the Form or Matter, Preparations, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Conditions, Moral Means, Merits of Dignity or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity, than there is in Thought and Opinion; and ſo a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er variety of Perſons, Profeſſions, Names and Ages of the World, than there is in the thing it ſelf: for all theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different Sentiments we may find amongſt the Papiſts themſelves. (1.) The groſſeſt of them, as <hi>Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> fay, Our Works Merit from their own Dignity, that God in ſtrict Juſtice could not but Reward ſuch Pains, ſuch Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, ſuch Faſtings and Prayers, with Heaven, or Eternal
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50846:24"/> Happineſs, this not true of <hi>Adams</hi> Covenant. But a ſecond, and more Moderate ſort, as <hi>Marſilius, Leonardus,</hi> &amp;c. admit of a Tripple Allay to render them Meritorious: And the firſt is, That Chriſt hath merited, that our Works may Merit: Ours as ſubordinate Conditions to an Intereſt in his: The ſecond is from Divine Ordination, becauſe though our Actions are not worth a Pardon, yet he hath Promiſed both a Pardon, and a Heaven for them: A third that lays Foundation for the former, is a natural Congruity and Aptneſs, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Worker ſhould have a Reward, and the ſincere Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer ſhould not be ſlighted, when the Bounty doth not Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh but Honour the Donor; and that a Penitent Perſon ſhould be pardoned: And ever ſince the <hi>Interim,</hi> at the firſt Birth of the Reformation, there has been a party amongſt Proteſtants, in little or nothing differing from them, called ſometimes <hi>Interimiſts, Caſſandrians, Majoriſts, Conditionaliſts, Calixtians;</hi> and others that have run as far to a no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extream, as <hi>Amſdorfius,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Good Works were ſo far from being neceſſary to Juſtification, that they were pernicious and hurtful to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not comprehend under Conditionaliſts, all who have aſſerted the Covenant to be Conditional, for they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd themſelves, that they mean no more by it, than the immediate and neareſt means of theſe Bleſſings, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Glory: And add many Cautious and Negative Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that deſtroy the proper Nature of a Condition; ſome five, ſome ten; but I ſee no Reaſon for their Zeal againſt them who ſay it's not Conditional; ſince they ſay it's three to one, five to one more not Conditional, than Conditional, <hi>viz.</hi> it's not Conditional Antecedently, it's not Conditional Naturally, it's not Conditinal Meritoriouſly, it's not Conditional Legally, it's not Conditional Uncertainly; and yet cry <hi>Error, Error,</hi> if another ſay it's not Conditional, and call it a Diſpoſition of Grace thorough means to a certain end; if we take the Word Condition in its vulgar uſe, for the whole ſtipulated part of the Bargain or Bond to be perform'd wholly by the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating party, its more apt to deceive vulgar People (who have that Idaea of Condition) to ſay its Conditional with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Limitation, than to ſay it's not Conditional; and do they think their Brethren have neither Power nor Skill to add Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50846:24"/> to their not Conditional, as well as they to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional? and fewer are Neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> tho' Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are Gifts of Grace, yet they are Duties; and tho' the Lord calls effectually where he will and when, yet our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is courted, and wooed, not forc'd; we freely yield to the Spirits Conduct, though our yielding is the Spirit's Effect, and Effects bear not the Name of Conditions.</p>
            <p>The Senſe then of the Apoſtle is this, That no Works Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial, Moral, with Faith or without it; by the Spirit of Grace, or Strength of Nature, external or internal, perfect or ſincere; no Works of any Law perform'd by us, are either Merits, Matter, Form, Legal Condition or Plea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for our Juſtification before God; they neither by Efficacy do Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it, nor by Dignity deſerve it: What the Apoſtle has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded without Limits, we ſhould. The Arguments for the Truth of this follows next in the Text.</p>
            <p>So I come now to the ſecond Part of the Verſe, which is the firſt Argument that proves we are not Juſtified by Works; <hi>He hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> The Argument is from the Topick of Impoſſibility or Abſurdity; the Matter is impoſſible, and the Action is abſurd, that ſuch a Worm as Man, or any thing that is a Creature, ſhould boaſt, or have ground of boaſting before its Maker: Much more abſurd is it for this Creature, becoming a Rebel and a Tranſgreſſor, to boaſt of its Meritting a Pardon, or rendring its Pardon a Juſtification: If a Slave ſhould break a Veſſel of great worth, and boaſt he could reſtore it, or fatisfie for the Dammage, when he is not his own, it would be unbecoming, but too mean a Type of this.</p>
            <p>There are three things to be Treated in the Argument: 1. The Form of it. 2. The Truth of it. 3. The Strength of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Form of the Argument is thus:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Maj.</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> were Juſtified by Works, he has Matter of glorying.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Min.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> has no Matter of glorying, <hi>at leaſt before God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Concl. Ergo, Abraham</hi> is not Juſtified by Works.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is the general Interpretation of Proteſtants, and ſome
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50846:25"/> others; <hi>Eraſmus, Vatablus, Calvin, Zegerus, Beza, Piſcator, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus, Dickſon, Hyperus, Melancton, Sclater, Tuckney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are Interpreters of great Number and Note, that form the Argument in a contrary Method, thus:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Maj.</hi> If <hi>Abraham</hi> were Juſtified by Works, he would have no Matter of Glorying before God.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Min.</hi> But <hi>Abraham</hi> had Matter of Glorying before God, <hi>viz. His Faith.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Concl.</hi> Therefore not Juſtified by Works.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen,</hi> the firſt Interpreter, ſays, if Faith had not been a real Glory before God, he would not have Imputed it to him in place of Works; but there is no Reaſon to Impute this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to <hi>Origen</hi> but his Popiſh Tranſlator (for we have no other <hi>Origen</hi> on this Epiſtle that I know.) <hi>Rufinus,</hi> as we may read in his Preface to that Epiſtle, <hi>p.</hi> 634. <hi>Baſil.</hi> 
               <q>They ſay there is ſo much of this work thy own, that thou ſhouldſt entitle it with thy own Name, not <hi>Origens:</hi> But tho' I have had an Herculean Labour in adding, diminiſhing and altering, yet I will not ſteal his Title that laid the Foundation, but let the Reader aſcribe the Merit of the Work to whom he will, to him or to me, I ſhall put both our Names in the Title.</q> They who form the Argument thus are of two kinds; either, 1. Thoſe who differ both in Form of the Argument, and in the Truth, as the Papiſt, <hi>Aquin. Sasbout, Eſtius,</hi> &amp;c. who ſay that Free-will affords a Man Matter of Glorying; by it he has made himſelf differ from others, Converted himſelf, Prepared himſelf, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Conditions of the Covenant: May not a Work-man glory in his Work? 2. Thoſe who only differ in Grammar and Form, as <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Fathers: <hi>Chryſ.</hi> Faith thinks highly of God, and ſo glorifies him: Therefore he gloried not that he loved God, but that God loved him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as <hi>Bucer, P. Mart.</hi> and alſo <hi>L. de Diu.</hi> His glorying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, was glorying in God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. <hi>He that glories let him glory in the Lord.</hi> Faith ſends a Man out of himſelf, to glory in God, and in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I reject this Form of the Argument, and embrace the former for theſe Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Propoſitions of the latter Argument are not in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50846:25"/> Text, but the contrary are; the Text ſays not, <hi>If Juſtified by Works, he has no Matter of glorying,</hi> but quite contrary, <hi>He has Matter of glorying if juſtified by Works;</hi> the Text ſays not, <hi>He has Matter of glorying before God,</hi> but, <hi>Not before God;</hi> ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Syllogiſm in the Text, all the other is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Both the Propoſitions of their Argument are falſe: The <hi>firſt</hi> is falſe, That <hi>Works afford no Matter of glorying;</hi> for <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Glorying is not excluded by the Law of Works: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. If we were Sav'd by Works, we would boaſt. An Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man has more Matter of Glorying in his Works that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Juſtification, than a Pardoned one whoſe Works deſerve Damnation. The <hi>Second</hi> is falſe, That <hi>Abraham</hi> had any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of glorying, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ? what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? if thou didſt receive, why doſt thou glory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We find the ſame Apoſtle forming the Argument accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the firſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. We are not Sav'd by Works, that we may not glory, <hi>v.</hi> 10. 1. Becauſe we are God's Work. 2. Thorough Chriſt, ſo a Relation there before. 3. Good Works the End, <hi>Ergo</hi> not the Mean: Chriſt the Mean to our Good Works, not Good Works the Mean of an Intereſt in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From the following Argument, <hi>v.</hi> 3. that Faith is imputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs, proves no matter of glorying in Faith: For, 1. It is a Gift, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. no glorying in a Gift, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. 2. Faith put for its Object, or containing its Object, makes glorying in God, not before God. 3. For the Exerciſe of Faith, which is receiving, truſting, depending, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no more Matter of boaſting before God, than the Beggar's glorying of his Receiving, before his Benefactor and his Bounty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thoſe who do not Err as to the Matter, commit a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fault in the Grammar of the Words: 1. To tranſlate, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>before God,</hi> or <hi>with God: in God</hi> or <hi>from God,</hi> as we may ſee from Parallel places, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. <hi>As of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we:</hi> Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith we have peace with God:</hi> 1 John. 3.21. <hi>If our Hearts Condemn us not, then have we Confidence towards God:</hi> So that the Senſe is, to have Matter of glorying, God being Judge and Witneſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Matter of Juſtification; for they differ but in this, that Juſtification preſuppoſes the Charge of a Crime, or Suſpition
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50846:26"/> of one: Praiſing or Glorying doth not: So that Praiſing and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying differ only as Comfort and Joy; and <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf being Judge, on <hi>John</hi> 1.1. this is the Senſe of the Phraſe. 2. Glorying in God is expreſſed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17. <hi>And makeſt thy boaſt of God:</hi> 1 Cor. 1.41. <hi>He that gloryeth, let him glory in the Lord:</hi> Pſal. 34.2. <hi>My Soul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord.</hi> Theſe two are vaſtly different; to have Matter of Glorying in our ſelves, in our Actions towards God, God himſelf being our Judge and Witneſs, and to Glory in God, his Favour and Kindneſs, when we have deſerved nothing but Wrath. A ſecond Grammatical Error is to think that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> differ in Scripture; for we find that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Glorying,</hi> is put for <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Matter of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>Our rejoicing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience;</hi> Rom. 15.17. <hi>I have therefore whereof I may Glory, in things that pertain to God:</hi> And ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the Act of Glorying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Your glorying is not good:</hi> 9.15. <hi>Make my glorying void:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.12. <hi>Occaſion to glory on our behalf.</hi> But beſide, if Man had Matter of Glorying, there might be juſtly glorying, where there is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> there may be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. God doth never deny any man his due. The deepeſt Degrees of Humility God requires, are but ſuitable Apprehenſions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations to what we are. And Laſtly, a Man's Works affords Matter of Glorying as well as his Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>James</hi> 2.20. God praiſes <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Works as well as his Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Criticks generally are againſt this Tranſlation; and ſo the Ancient Verſions, as the <hi>Ethiopick,</hi> which puts <hi>a Reward</hi> here in place of <hi>Glorying;</hi> and the <hi>Arabick,</hi> which ſays, <hi>If he was Juſtified by Works, he ſhould have Glory in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is the making of a Neutral Verb active, without any Authentick Examples to Countenance it.</p>
            <p>But I come to the ſecond thing, which is the Truth of the Argument, <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>had no Matter of Glorying before God.</hi> I ſhall form it into this general Doctrine.</p>
            <q>That no meer Man has any Matter of Glorying before God.</q>
            <p>This I ſhall Confirm and Illuſtrate from theſe four general Topicks.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) From Mans Exiſtence and Being.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) From his Conſtitution or Eſſence.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50846:26"/>(3.) From his Undoing of himſelf, his ruining and deſtroying his Soul by Sin, his guilt; which not only affords matter for Humility, but of mixing it with Sorrow, Shame and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Face.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) From our Impotence to reſtore our ſelves from this Fall, tho' there is matter in it to remove our Sorrow, none to remove our Humility, or lay a Foundation of our Glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt of theſe Topicks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our Being or Exiſtence; this has ſeven Properties that are inſeparable from it, or from any Creature; whether Angels above us or Beaſts below us: They are the ſeven Properties of a Creature as a Creature, and the juſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, is that which makes Angels never Mind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but be unwearied, and without Intermiſſion taken up with the Praiſes and Contemplations of a God: Theſe are the things which make Seraphims cover their Face and their Feet with their Wings.</p>
            <p>The firſt is Creatures Contingency; that is, tho it now is, it might not have been, and may not be again; there is no repugnancy to <hi>not Being</hi> in its Conſtitution; which I ſhall thus Illuſtrate. Before our Birth we were not Men: Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts that pretend our matter to have been from Eternity, and that when we dye, we only diſſolve into that Common Maſs; yet they grant, that we begin to be Men, and ceaſe to be Men, and that every individual Man hath a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If there is no Neceſſity of our being Men, there is no Neceſſity of our being any thing, eſpecially Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Man, as Matter is owned to be; for Neceſſity of Exiſtence, is a high Perfection: Contingency that borders next to nothing, is a great Imperfection; and therefore the greater Perfection is to be placed in the more perfect Being. Therefore if no Neceſſity of his Being man, there is no Neceſſity of being any thing Inferiour to him. Neceſſary Exiſtence muſt be the Attribute of ſomething, for ſince ſomething now is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing always has been, and that which hath been always, doth Exiſt by the Intrinſick Perfection of its own Eſſence; for what ſuffers nothing to be before it, admits of no Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50846:27"/> Cauſe. But, (2.) That which hath the leaſt Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any kind, it wants this Perfection of neceſſary Exiſtence; whatever has any Imperfection, is but a Contingent thing. For if there be not a reality of Perfection, to exclude a little Imperfection, there cannot be a ſufficient reality to exclude a greater Imperfection. If the fulneſs of the Beings Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, do not include a leſſer Perfection, they cannot include a greater; for inſtance, if Matter cannot include among its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections theſe leſſer ones of Thinking, Reaſoning, Speaking, Feeling, it cannot include a more Noble Perfection of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Exiſtence; for not to be, is a greater Imperfection than not to be Reaſonable, or not to be Senſitive: Neceſſary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence is at the greateſt diſtance from not Being that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and therefore, ſince not Being is the greateſt Imperfection, neceſſary Being is the greateſt Perfection; and whatever has it muſt want no Perfection; and whatever wants it, is but a Contingent thing. (3.) All that own a God, own that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Exiſtence is his incommunicable Attribute; and does contain an incomparable, an incomprehenſible Perfection; it is the higheſt Degree of removal from nothing, a grain of Duſt is better than nothing; all Creatures are in a middle State between Nothing and a neceſſary Being; Nothing is not, Gods Name is Being, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I am what I am, his Name alone is Jehovah.</hi> But Creatures are indifferent to be, and not to be; there is no repugnancy in us againſt Being, nor no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility in our Conſtitution to hinder us from not Being. Chriſt himſelf bears a Similitudinary Image of Independency, becauſe having once a Life given, he is ſaid to have Life in himſelf, in his own Power; but there is no Image of this Neceſſary Exiſtence: Atheiſm is very unreaſonable to place this Perfection in Matter, which as the Reverend Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> ſays, is next to Nothing, for it can do nothing; and ſhall we place the Attribute that is moſt diſtant from Nothing, in the Subject which is next to nothing. What great ground of Humility doth this afford, that I am more than a Fly! it is of God not of me, that I differ from the Duſt, or the Dirt I tread on, I owe it to God; I am not ſo much as one Breath, yea the ſmalleſt particle of the moſt ſubtil Air of my ſelf; that I am more than meer nothing, is wholly of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am oblig'd and indebted for it. But, (4.) All who
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50846:27"/> own the Scriptures, own that Man is a made Creature; a Workmanſhip of Divine Art, and a Fruit of his meer good Pleaſure. That he might have made us, or not made us, as he would, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. <hi>That the Thing form'd, ſay to him that form'd it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Iſa. 45.9. Our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is from his Power, our Futurity is from his Will, our Exiſtence from his Act, our Matter, our Duſt was his by abſolute Propriety, and our Form is the Effect of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are Dependent, Experience proves this; we depend of our Parents, and yet not ſolely, for they dye and we ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive; we depend on Meat, Drink, Air, yet not only, for our Life is more Noble than they; nothing can give or communicate what it has not; there muſt be ſome more noble Independent Being, <hi>in whom we live, move, and have our Being<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since we are Contingent, we muſt alſo be Dependent, for Contingency is no more determin'd to Being, than not Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Perſeverance than Periſhing: for ſuch as our Nature was <hi>in primo fieri,</hi> ſo it remains; a Contingent thing is a Tottering Being, of it ſelf inclinable any way, and External Force forces it's Lot. 3. It's a Prerogative of God to be Independent, a Spirit Independent is the beſt Definition we can form of him, and it is his Glory to have all things Depending on him; the whole Maſs of Beings, to be nurs'd by the Breaſts of his Alſufficient Fulneſs; he is a Careful Parent of his Off-ſpring, it is no Toil to his Power, nor Difficulty to his Wiſdom, nor Draining to his unſearchable Riches, where all is Infinite; but a wonderful diſcovery of that Plenty that is in him, which is his very End and Deſign: How ſhould this ſtop the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mouth, ſilence the glorying Tongue, and ſtifle the proud Thoughts of Man! If thy Dependance were a bare Permiſſion, that thou cannot live an hour on Gods Earth without his leave, or uſe his Creatures for Profit or Pleaſure; he can ſweep thee off the Stage of Being with a Beeſom of Deſtruction in a Minute: But Dependency is a Divine Manutenency, it's a keeping us up by force from falling into that Pit or Abyſs of Nothing we were drawn out of, and ſtill hang over, <hi>Job</hi>

There is no neceſſary Connexion between the Creation of any thing, and its Continuance; becauſe we were Yeſterday, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that we ſhall be to Morrow; we daily change, we are not to Day what Yeſterday, there is no ſuch Inference where the Being is Contingent; how gladly would we live, but it is not in the Power of our Will, our Nature, or all our Friends and Phyſicians; no Cordial, no Food, no Phyſician can do; and if they cannot preſerve Life, far leſs Being. The Glorious Arches of the Heaven would dwindle away, the Depth of the Ocean dry up, the ſteady Earth tremble into a Non-entity; the moſt Immortal Spirits faint, and Angels be annihilate by one Minutes Intermiſſion of Omnipotency: A Proud Man is a Mad Man, a deceiv'd Soul; thou cannot move thy Tongue, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thy Thought, but thou art under an Infinite Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Infinite help for ſupporting thee in it, and wilt thou uſe it againſt him? the more perfect we are, the more we depend; the more imperfect we are, the more we need his Power to ſupport us.</p>

No more Night and Day, the Foundation of Chronology. But Aeviternity, or Time, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd by Succeſſive Motion ſtill continues in Heaven; for the Mind of an Angel is not Infinite, therefore comprehends not all Objects at once, nor doth not comprehend the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible God, for that is Inconſiſtent with Adoration or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, which ſtill ſuppoſes ſomething unknown; therefore of Neceſſity their Minds change its Objects, ſometimes think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one thing, ſometimes of another, and conſequently one thing in Order before another, and Time is a Motion thorough former and latter: This affords another Argument, that this World is not from Eternity, becauſe Succeſſive; for where a former and latter, a ſecond, third and fourth, there is a firſt and laſt; this may be rendred more eaſie by theſe Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

            <p n="5">5.

A Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Statue formed in the likeneſs of a Man is more a Stone than Man, becauſe the one by Art, the other by Nature: So Man, by Nature he is nothing, by Divine Art he is God's Image: We are from Nothing, that is our Original, for we are brought into being by the Force and Violence of Omnipotent Power.

Since any one of theſe affords matter of Humiliation, how much more all being put together? and if they afford matter of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation for Angels, how much more matter of Humiliation for Man? If an Angel be but a Contingent, Dependent, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, Temporary, Paſſive, Imaginary Being, a Being more Nothing than Being in Compariſon of God, how little a thing muſt Man be in Compariſon of him, and how much leſs a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Man?</p>
            <p>I come to the ſecond Topick of Arguments for the Proof of this Doctrine, <hi>That Man has nothing to Glory in before God;</hi> which is the Form he was made in, and by which he Excells other Earthly Creatures, and is called an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Lord of his own Actions, a Self-powered Creature, or as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, a Power of Living as he will. The Common Title for it is <hi>Free-will, Liberum Arbitrium,</hi> which <hi>Amyrald</hi> thinks to be better Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

The former Argument is more commonly granted, That Man cannot be Proud of his Being, but therein ſtill he would be Equal to the Angels; and the Pride of Man can hardly aſpire higher, but for this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Man has no Matter of glorying from his <hi>Free Will,</hi> is not ſo eaſily Complyed with, whether we View Men's Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or their Practices. (1.) The Pagans, they commonly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all Virtue, all their Heroick Actions, and the Praiſe of 'em, to themſelves: Upon this Account <hi>Cicero, De Natura Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> ſays, <q>We may thank God for Riches, or Fortune, but not for Virtue, that is our own; for that we are Praiſed, for the want of that we are blamed: We may glory of our Virtue, which we could not do if it were God's Gift.</q>

We are not to ſeparate Man's Will from enclining Fate: ſo that the Senſe of it is, Providence gives Occaſion to Work, but the Work it ſelf is wholly Man's own. (3.) The <hi>Pelagians</hi> are not inferiour in this Pride to any of the former, who confine all God's Grace to Man, in giving of this Noble and Natural Endowment of Free-Will, by which a Man is able to do all good Commanded. They ſay none can give a Man ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Riches but himſelf, for theſe he is juſtly Praiſed, and <hi>jure</hi> Preferred to others; for theſe can have no Being but in himſelf and from himſelf; hence he taught this Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <q>Lord behold the Purity of my Lips, by which I Pray to thee, and the Innocency of my Hands which I ſtretch forth before thee.</q> (4.) The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> tho' others ſeem to diminiſh the Power of Free-Will when they write on that Head, yet when they come to the Point of Merit, they again extoll it, <hi>Bel de Juſt. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. becauſe it is more honourable to obtain a thing by Merit than by Grace alone; therefore that God might Honour his Children, he has granted that they might prepare Eternal Life to themſelves by their Merits, and more proudly; <hi>Ruard. in Top.

               </gap>eats and Labours; and their Common Doctrine is, that by the ſtrength of Nature preparing our ſelves we Merit <hi>ex Congruo,</hi> ſpecial Grace, and afterwards being made juſt by it, we can ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfill the Law, that we Merit Heaven <hi>ex Condigno,</hi> and why may not a Workman glory in his Work? (5.) <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who hold the Freedom of the Will inconſiſtent with any Neceſſity, and that it is out of the Power of God effectually to Call a Sinner when he will, or according to the Terms in Diſpute: Grace is always reſiſtable, but the Will of Man unconquerable. (6.) We find many others, and more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, too much extolling Man on this account, as <hi>Prudentius</hi> in his Poems on that Subject:
<q>Inſubjecte potens, rerum arbiter, arbiter idem &amp; judex Mentis propriae.</q>
               <q>Powerfull, being ſubject to none, Lord of all things, Lord alſo and Judge of thy own Mind: And elſewhere, "He that

He that made thee King of the World, would he not make thee King of thy ſelf? would he ſo Curtail thine Honour and Matter of glorying?</q> Beſides, the common Definition of it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no leſs, that ſuppoſing all things in act that are fit, or have Power to move or encline it, it may Act or not Act, or act the contrary as it will: Neither God nor Angels, Men or Devils, have Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> certainly to determine it. (7.) They who have their Minds better inſtructed, yet have Practical Sentiments ſecretly latent in their Minds of this kind, which we may learn from our Obſervation of our ſelves: As, 1. When Men adventure on ſin becauſe they think they can make amends by Repentance. 2. When Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſons delay Repentance upon this ground, that they can do it afterwards. 3. When Perſons ſtifle Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and quench the Spirit, becauſe they think they can enjoy it again when they will. 4. When Perſons do not Pray, from this latent Error, that they have a Power to Accompliſh their Deſigns themſelves. 5. When men Neglect the outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Means of Salvation, which God has appointed not only as Means between Us and the End, but as Means between our <hi>Can</hi> and our <hi>Cannot,</hi> becauſe we cannot do any thing of the Eſſentials of Salvation, Meriting Pardon, Enlightning the Underſtanding, or Sanctifying our Wills, God has preſcribed theſe Means that we can do, and has Promiſed to Perform that which we cannot, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Work in and about your own Salvation with fear and trembling, for he worketh in you to will and to do:</hi> Now that which many Neglect the Means for, is becauſe they think they can go about the thing it ſelf. The Security that deſtroys the moſt of periſhing Souls is founded on this corrupt Root, that we have a Power in a very ſhort time to do all the Buſineſs of our Salvation. Were it not for this, Sinners Deſpairing wholly in themſelves wou'd be rolling themſelves in the Duſt, and proſtrating themſelves before a Father of Mercies and God of Grace, and conſtantly Watching for the Angels troubling of the Waters; they would be daily waiting at Wiſdoms Gates for the Spirit promiſed to Attendants upon appointed Means.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to all this, I ſhall lay down theſe Eight Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, with their ſeveral Confirmations, to prove that this Noble Principle that God hath endowed Man with, though it hath exalted him above Brutes, it affords him no ground of Pride,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50846:31"/> or glorying before God; four are Poſitive, and four Negative.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Free-Will is a part of that Excellency by which Man is the Image of God: All in Man by which he excells meer Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, he therein is God's Image. This is a great Dignity, to be in the Image of God, but this ſhould humble Man before God, becauſe he is but an Image; tho' in reſpect of inferiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they being only a <hi>Veſtigium,</hi> or a Print of ſome one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; as the Print of a Man's Foot repreſents but one part of him, an Image repreſents the whole or moſt principal Parts. Free-will is founded in Wiſdom and Power, and in theſe Man is God's Image, but this Excellency affords no Matter of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. (1.) From the Scriptures own Expreſſion, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 39.6. there is a Reaſon given, why Man in his beſt Eſtate, that is, in the Purity of his Nature, in the unfaded and unſtained flower of all his Senſes and ſpiritual Faculties, is but Vanity; becauſe every Man <hi>walks in a Vain ſhew,</hi> ſo we Tranſlate it, but the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is <hi>Bezalim,</hi> the ſame Word which in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. is uſed for the <hi>Image of God.</hi> Man is Vanity, becauſe at beſt but an Image. Our greateſt Perfections by Nature did not free us from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility. (2.) Indifferency doth not repreſent the Will of God as terminate upon himſelf, but as terminate upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; to him it was indifferent whether they ſhould be or not be: They are <hi>Luſus Dei,</hi> the Fruit of his meer Pleaſure, things of no moment; ſo when we experience in our ſelves that the Foot, the Tongue, the Hands, the Eyes, move in Obedience to the Will as Nimbly as we can think, it do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not repreſent God's Eſſence, but his Relative Sovereignty over his Creatures, ſo 'tis but an inferiour part of an Image. (3.) The Will of God is a Power, and cauſes theſe real goods that are its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; but the Liberty of Man is only admiſſive or rejective of theſe Objects in the Underſtanding, and gives occaſion to their Influence upon the Faculties of the Soul, and ſo affords no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Glory in the Work of our Converſion. Suppoſe the Sun-beams ſhould enter a Room before dark, by ſome Caſement or Cranny, and fill this room with Light, yea, render its Earth flouriſhing and verdant, ſhould we aſcribe this great Change to the Sun or to the Caſement? Nay, ſuppoſe farther, that the Sun by its perpetual Heat and repeated Influence has made the Boards give way, and made its own entrance, ſhould we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the Glory of the Action to that which ſo long hindered
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50846:32"/> it, and is yet the Cauſe of the Works being ſo weak? And this is the very Caſe, as far as Matter can repreſent Spirit; for the Lord opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and he ſays <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, and if any Man open I will come in.</hi> (4.) The Will of God never acts without the higheſt Wiſdom, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>According to the Counſel of his Will:</hi> Therefore the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of a Liberty in Man, diſtinct from the Conduct of the Underſtanding, is a Chimera, no Image of God, who cannot deny himſelf in any of his Works, he never did any thing that might give us falſe Sentiments of his Nature. (5.) Our Liberty is much inferiour to God's, becauſe of the Narrowneſs of its Sphere: The Beaſt has only Senſe, Man has alſo ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things for his Object to Converſe about, but the Divine Will converſes about thoſe things we never ſaw nor heard, nor has it entered into our Heart to conceive. (6.) Our Liberty is a Gift, God's is Self-originate; ours a Shadow, his the Subſtance; ours but an Emanation of his, as the Image of a Face in a Glaſs, but we have no ſuch Help diſtinct from him, he is the Support and Spring of both. (7.) His is Infallible, always equal, vigorous, active; Ours faints and wearies, as in Sleep and Infancy, and fails, as in every Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Prop.</hi> The Liberty of the Mind of Man conſiſts (to be more particular about it) in a Freedom from Phyſical Neceſſity or Coaction, in a Freedom from Senſe or Matter: It is a general Axiom, and therefore needs the leſs proof, That Free-will is only the Property of thinking and reaſoning Creatures, that propoſe an End to their Actions, and deliberate about what is fitteſt for gaining that End. The Fire burns whatever comes nigh it, but the Will doth not chooſe every thing propoſed. The Imagination of a Beaſt is confined to Material Ideas, but the Mind of Man is not determined nor limited to ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: A Beaſt can only be allured by preſent things, but things of a hundred years diſtance can move a Mind; this is a great Priviledge, but affords no matter of Glory.

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to take it in this ſence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.37. <hi>Having no Neceſſity, but hath power over his own Will, and hath ſo decreed in his heart.</hi> By Freedom from Neceſſity there, is meant a Power to put his Purpoſe in Execution: And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>What I would, that do I not.

As we ſee among ſenſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſome are confined to the Water, as Fiſh, ſome to the Earth; but others have a more ample Sphere of Activity, and a more vigorous Principle to carry them through Water, Earth or Air.

               </gap>tand Earthly things: <hi>John</hi> 3. Chriſt tells <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi> that there was a Neceſſity of repreſenting Heavenly things under ſome Earthly Similitude, that we might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of underſtanding them.

They that are accuſtomed to do evil, can no more do good than the <hi>Aethiopian can change his Skin,</hi> or the <hi>Leopard his Spots.</hi> (3) All Afflictions and Sufferings put Reſtraints on Mans Liberty. <hi>John</hi> 21.18. <hi>Thou girdeſt thy ſelf and walkedſt whither thou wouldſt;</hi> here was Liberty: <hi>but another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldſt not;</hi> here is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or Compulſion. A man may have a will to move a gouty Finger, or ſtop a Convulſive or Paralitick Motion of his Nerves, but he has no Liberty to do it, as Dr. <hi>Lock</hi> ſays well. (4) In our Intellect and elicit acts of the Will we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience this Compulſion; we would love God as the Angels doe, but we cannot: How many would throw off Terrors, Convictions impreſſed on their Minds, but they cannot? We cannot keep our Mind at eaſe when the Body is under pain. (5) How little do we know in things Natural, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Pains that has been given by Students, and far leſs in things ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Prop.</hi> There is a Liberty of Indifferency in Man about many things that are in his Power to do, whether Natural, Moral, and after received Grace, Spiritual alſo. (1) Our common Experience witneſſeth this; in matters of Contrariety, as telling the Truth or a Lye; matters of Diſparity or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, as going to the Church to Prayer, or about ſome other buſineſs of our Vocation or Calling, or what is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; in matters of Contradiction, to do a thing or omit it. (2) There are many Examples in Scripture that witneſs this: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. There are three Judgments propos'd to <hi>David</hi>'s Choice, about which he had not only a Moral but Phyſical power. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.5. <hi>Solomon</hi> had four things put in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ask of God, long Life, Riches, the Life of his Enemies, or Wiſdom. It was propos'd to <hi>Adam</hi>'s choice by what Name to call any Creature, and of what Tree to eat. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4.17. <hi>Paul</hi> had a power <hi>to eat and drink,</hi> and there was a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity upon him by Moral Obligation to <hi>preach the Goſpel,</hi> which he might perform willingly or againſt his Will: <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.13, 15. <hi>Numbers</hi> 30. there are more Examples of this kind. (3.) Without owning this Indifferency in Man, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50846:33"/> the Holineſs of God: There can be no greater Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than to think or ſay that God is the Author of Sin, or to aſſert any thing that does of Neceſſity inferr it, for it takes away all place for Repentance, and fills the Soul with moſt dreadful Apprehenſions of a Deity, <hi>viz.</hi> To make a Man ſin, which is worſe than to tempt him, and then to Puniſh him, it darkens the Beauty and Glory of the Divine Eſſence. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is that which the Saints and Angels trebble in his Praiſe, and they know him beſt. The whole Syſtem of the Scripture declares God's Innocency as to this thing, for it declares that God made Man upright, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. and the Angels alſo, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. He made them in his own Image. (2.) He gave him a Holy Law to keep him from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. and he fenc'd Obedience to that Law by moſt terrible Threatnings, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye;</hi> and with great ſpeed he did execute the Puniſhment, for ſpiritually he dyed that very Moment he ſinn'd, and the ſtroke reach'd the very Inſtruments of the Sin, and by no influence could God incline or determine him to what he did forbid, for with him is no Unfaithfulneſs or Unſincerity, nor want of Holineſs. (3.) <hi>James</hi> 1.13. God tempts no Man, he cannot deny himſelf; but to Neceſſitate Man to ſin, is to do the ſin, and can God do what he hates? <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.7. Beſides, if Sin were not voluntary and free, it would not be a ſin; would that be againſt God which was from God? could it be Guilt wherein Man was wholly a Sufferer? (4.) The very Nature of Permiſſion, which is of purpoſe and deſignedly to let that be which he can hinder: <hi>Geneſis</hi> 20.9. <hi>Abimelech</hi> did not ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God did not ſuffer him; if he had ſuffer'd him he would have ſinn'd; as in the inſtance of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> God left him to try him, that it might be known what was in his Heart: So where God permits, man has a Phyſical Liberty to do or not to do. God did permit <hi>Adam</hi> to ſin, for if he had deſign'd to impede him, he could not have done it. We muſt not Clip divine Power, more than Stain divine Purity: Omnipotency would be turn'd into Impotency, if <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd whether God would or no: He could have Chain'd up Satan from laying the Bait, or <hi>Adam</hi> from ſwallowing of it; but on the other Hand, as he did not hinder him from it, he did not predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him to it: Whether the firſt act of ſin be Pride, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or Inconſideration; God could not incline the Will to an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50846:34"/> Averſeneſs to his own Amiableneſs, or Diſtruſt of his own Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or Diſobedience to his own Commands. (5.) With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing this Indifferency, there were no room for the Office of a Magiſtrate: Could <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſay to <hi>Achan, Why haſt thou troubled us? the Lord ſhall trouble thee this day,</hi> Joſh. 7.25. There could be no room for Praiſe or Rebuke, and there would ſtill be place for ſome Excuſe in Man. He that wanted the Wedding Garment would not have been ſpeechleſs altogether, if there had been an Impoſſibility of attaining it; he was brought a Beggar from the High ways and from the Hedges, and ſo had no Wedding-garments of himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.9. but it was to be put on freely; and tho' Man is now a Slave to ſin, yet multitude of particular ſins he might have omitted.</p>
            <p>This brings me to the ſecond and principal thing, That this Liberty of Indifferency is no Matter of Glorying, but a great Matter of Humiliation before God: for, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Will often flows from Fluctuation of the Judgment: Ignorance in the Underſtanding occaſions Uncertainty in our Choice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. We are <hi>alienate from the Life of God,</hi> thro' the Ignorance of its Excellency and Beauty. This Ignorance conſiſts, (1.) In Uncertainty and Doubtfulneſs: We doubt if there be a God, a Devil, a Heaven or a Hell; that makes 'em have leſs Power in determining our Choice. (2.) In Short-ſightedneſs, like a Pur-blindneſs in the Mind, that the future Puniſhment or Reward appears little, the preſent Pain or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure great. If the Sickneſs and Trouble that is conſequential to Drunkenneſs, Prodigality, Vileneſs, were as nigh to our Sight and View, as the Sin or the Act is, we would never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; if the Pain of the aking Head were in the Pallat, when the Drunkard drinks up the Glaſs, he would never ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it down: And if Temporal Puniſhments, becauſe at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, appear ſo little, how much leſs does Eternal. (3.) In Narrow-ſightedneſs: Our Underſtandings are like ſmall-mouth'd Veſſels, that can only take in one thing at once. Hence we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckon the preſent Pain the worſt, and the preſent Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſweeteſt, becauſe it ſo fills the Narrow Mind, that there is no room for other Idea's. (4.) In groſs and carnal Corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ſpiritual things are ſo ſubtil that they do not ſuit its Diſpoſition; hence we ſcarce feel an Appetite after Spiritual things, but the Appetite of the Fleſh is ſtrong, its Urgency pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50846:34"/> the Deliberation, and does not allow a due time for ballancing the Account, and ſtating the Coſt on both ſides: this affords great Matter of Humility, that our Spirits are ſo weak, and Underſtandings ſo dark. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy flows from the Meanneſs of the Object, or different Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Subject, when the things propos'd are Trifles, of no great Moment or Concern, or indifferently ſuiting our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Temper, then we are indifferent about them; the more we are imploy'd about ſuch things, to ſo much the leſs purpoſe do we ſpend our Lives, and therefore have the leſs Matter of Boaſting in them; for there is a great difference between our Indifference and <hi>Adam</hi>'s, that was to good or bad; ours to Bad, and has its Choice of Bads. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency flows from Divine Permiſſion, as is before proved; but a far greater Bleſſing it is to be inclin'd and determin'd by God, than to be left to our own Conduct; for God always inclines the Heart to good, and we never read of any left to themſelves and their own Determinations, that did good; therefore <hi>David</hi> Prays, <hi>Incline my Heart to thy Teſtimonies. Adam</hi> was permitted to his own Will, and he fell; and ſo it is ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> Pſal. 81.12. <hi>I gave them up to their own Hearts-luſt, and they walked in their own Counſels:</hi> Acts 14.16. <hi>He ſuffer'd all Nations to walk in their own ways;</hi> and theſe were Idolatry and Profanity: But he did not permit <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20.9. and he did not permit <hi>Laban,</hi> and therefore they did not ſin. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> From the Natural Mutability and Defectibility of the Creature, we being, as is before proved, Contingent, Dependent Creatures. The Indifferency of the Will is the tottering of the Creature, it's like the reeling and ſtaggering of a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Man, or like a Poſt ſet up before fixed, if the Upholders withdraw their Hands, and permit it to it ſelf, it declines one way or other. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Indifferency gave Birth to the firſt ſin of Angels and Man: He put them in a good State, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. but they left it; <hi>He made man upright,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. <hi>but he found out many Inventions. Sixthly,</hi> This is the great Impediment that hinders Mens Converſion, their Repentance and turning to God, Pſal. 81.11. <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice, and Iſrael would none of me:</hi> It's always laid at the Door of this Will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. <hi>I would have gather'd you as a Hen doth her Chickens, but you would not. Seventhly,</hi> All theſe great Crimes and actual
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50846:35"/> Tranſgreſſions which would the Conſcience, flow from this Spring, as now wrongly byaſs'd by Corruption. There is a conſiderable difference between the good things a Man can do, and what he does, and all that Guilt is chargeable upon his Will as indifferent; for if it be not within his Power, then he is not indifferent to it. This loads the Soul of Man with Guilt, if we conſider our Powers, which comprehends ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Talents given of God to be Improved by us, and all the Miſ-improvement lyes at this door of our Will. (1.) A Man's Tongue, together with all his Senſes, eſpecially thoſe that are the Inſtruments of Diſcipline, Seeing and Hearing, theſe are entirely under the Dominion of our Will, ard therefore either the Omiſſion of them where they ought to have been employ'd, or the Exerciſing of them where they ought to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, renders us ſo far Guilty. (2.) Our Health, Strength, Eſtate, Honour, Acquaintance, how great a Sphere of Power do they afford, eſpecially to ſome Men, and yet how little Good, or rather how much Miſchief is done by it? (3.) Our Reaſon is a conſiderable Talent for bridling our Senſes, for ſearching into the certainty of Religion, Natural or Reveal'd, for comparing of Spiritual with Carnal, Eternal with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things. (4.) Our Memories are a Treaſury for Divine Commands, Convictions, Comforts and Experiences. (5.) Our Conſciences for empowering Practical Light; its Power is of a large extent in keeping in aw from ſin, and in quickening to Duty. (6.) Providential Diſpenſations, that we have them through all our Life, to obſerve God's Method of dealing with Man, that we may ſee how Good and Patient he is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. We may learn that verily there is a God that Judgeth the Earth, and that verily there is a Reward for the Righteous. (7.) The Revelation of the Goſpel, with that Spirit that uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attends it, to Convince of Sin, Righteouſneſs and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is yet a far greater Power, and when it grows up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Converſion, and God's Gifts crown'd with Special Grace, how much more is the Power of Man heightened, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Being then made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>By the Grace of God I am what I am.</hi> What great Progreſs in Religion may a Man make, that is endowed with all theſe Powers, and how unexcuſable are their blameable Lives and Converſations! Few can with <hi>Paul</hi> ſay,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50846:35"/> 
               <hi>The Grace that was beſtowed upon me was not in vain, but I labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more abundantly than they all. Laſtly,</hi> Should a Sinner Glory in that which has render'd him void of all Cloak and Excuſe to his Sin? but this Will of Indifferency, conſidering the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers God has given Man, and is ſtill ready to give more or more upon asking or admitting, it renders Men, eſpecially that live under the Goſpel, altogether without Excuſe; for what Excuſe can a Man make for the Neglect of ſuch a Concern, if it or any thing tending to it lye within the Compaſs of Poſſibility? Difficulties can be no Excuſes, to ſay with the Sluggard, he could not Plow nor Sow in the Winter, becauſe it was Cold: If a Man has exerciſed his Power as much other ways, he cannot excuſe his Neglect of it in things tending to Salvation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. Chriſt tells the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that they might as eaſily Collect by the Exerciſe of their Reaſon about Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Prophecies, that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> as they did the fair and fowl Weather in the Morning from the Evening-skye. If Perſons once could be more frequent and ſerious in the Duties of Religion, when Self-Intereſt went along with it, and the Profeſſion of Godlineſs brought External Gain, or when a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Rod was on their Back, than they do now; this Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can have no Excuſe, for neither the one nor the other did or can contribute Strength to the Exerciſe of Religion. It is not in vain that the Scripture lays our Deſtruction at the door of our Wills, for if there be a Will, God accepts it for the Performance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a Man hath:</hi> 2 Sam. 17.20. A <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation</hi> under the ſenſe of Impotency is accepted for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance. Religion lyes within the Sphere of the Spirit, and the Spirit's comprehenſive Faculties are Light and Love, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Inclination, or Underſtanding and Will. (2.) Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are often glad they want Power or Opportunity of doing good, when Magiſtracy and Miniſtry are Prophane, they are glad of it: <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.31. <hi>The Prophets propheſie falſely, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my People love to have it ſo:</hi> Hoſ. 5.11. <hi>Ephraim is oppreſſed and broken in Judgment, becauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly walked after the Commandment:</hi> Iſa. 66.3. <hi>Their Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in their abominations.</hi> (3.) Becauſe they Fancy they have a Power to do what is ſpiritually Good, and yet Neglect Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means, either Poſitive in External Ordinances, or Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50846:36"/> in Omitting cf Vices and Outward Wickedneſſes. (4.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not frequent and ſerious in asking the Strength they want, or readily complyant with Power offered, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24. How often are we prevented with Convictions and Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about good Reſolutions that we don't kindly entertain, as if they came Meſſengers from Heaven, but throw them off with that Violence that we ought to do Temptations from Hell! Should we be proud of that which is a Defect of our Nature, and ſuppoſes a Defect in the Underſtanding? that which we never did Good by? that which all our Evil came by? that which removes all Excuſableneſs from our Evil?</p>
            <p>I Inſiſt more on this for the Uſe it may have, than the need of it for an Argument; for the Will being limited to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as ſhall be afterwards prov'd, <hi>Ignoti nulla Cupido,</hi> it is only indifferent about trifles, or what the Underſtanding thinks ſo; the Concerns of Salvation and Happineſs are none of its Objects as ſuch; when God puts Life and Death, that is the Means of them, to our Choice, we count them fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, until God give an Underſtanding; when we diſcern them of ſuch a Concern, indifferency is gone.</p>
            <p>I come now to thoſe Prerogatives falſely attributed to the Will of Man, that is the Sink of all the Spiritual Pride and ſhamefull Boaſting in ſinfull Man. I may reduce them to theſe four:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Freedom from all Neceſſity, eſſential to the Will of Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Freedom from the Empire of God as to Fact, though not Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Freedom from the Conduct of the Underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Freedom to all kind of things whatſoever, ſenſitive, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſpiritual, heavenly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a Freedom from all Neceſſity, or a Freedom of Indifferency, is not eſſential to the Will of Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Liberty is only Eſſential to the Will of Man, that renders him worthy of Reward or Puniſhment, Praiſe or Blame, by reaſon of his Actions; but a Man is thus free and thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in his moſt neceſſary Actions, which admits of no indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency; for Man purſues his ultimate and Supreme Happineſs neceſſarily, nothing can deſire to be miſerable. Enjoyment of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50846:36"/> God in the moſt intimate Fellowſhip we are capable of, is our greateſt Happineſs, and yet it is worthy of greateſt praiſe to purſue this end: when a Man's Self, either Self-will, Self-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or Self-profit, ſeems to him the laſt End, he neceſſarily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues it, and yet is worthy of Reproof and Puniſhment for it. Self-Denial is the higheſt Vertue, and Self-ſeeking the greateſt Sin. Moreover, when any thing appears either as an only or a neceſſary Means to obtain this great End, being formally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as ſuch, is as neceſſarily purſued as the End it ſelf. If our Underſtandings were Illuminated, we would as neceſſarily and as fervently ſeek an Intereſt in Chriſt the Mediator, as in God the End: We are as much bent and determined to Food, as to preſervation of our Life.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) When all Neceſſary Cauſes are preſuppoſed in Act, the the Effect muſt neceſſarily follow: Therefore if Divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the attractive Power of the Object be ſet forth by the moſt clear Light in the Underſtanding, the Will muſt be perſwaded; or elſe it muſt not be a perſwadable Appetite, if any reaſon can be given why it was not moved by theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then all Neceſſary Cauſes are not in Exerciſe; if none can be given, the Will is not a reaſonable Appetite, but our Experience ſpeaks the contrary, that when we refuſe a thing one day, and embrace it another, it is by more ſeriouſly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter, and find it appears more ſuitable to us.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) What is Eſſential to a thing, is inſeparable from it, univerſally and perpetually agreeing to the whole Species; but this Indifferency is not ſo to a Will, for the Will of God is not indifferent to Good and Evil, nor the Will of Chriſt, whoſe Righteouſneſs was Meritorious, nor the Will of Angels, who do moſt freely Praiſe their Maker.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) What is Eſſential to the Will as in other things, is moſt viſible when the Will is in its greateſt perfections, as hardneſs in a Marble, not Lead; whiteneſs in Snow; therefore the Eſſential Perfections of the Will are moſt viſible in God and Chriſt, Angels and Saints, that are moſt determinate in their Deſigns and Actions.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) What is Eſſential to the Soul, is beſt known when it is moſt perfect, for Defects make not up the Nature of any thing. Chriſt was a Man, tho not ſinful, therefore Sin is not a Neceſſary Property of Man. Man is a reaſonable Creature,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50846:37"/> tho' there are many Fools or Mad-men; and it is as reaſonable to draw the Eſſentials of a Spirit from the Common Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a ſinful Man Unregenerate, as from the Common Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Fools or M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Will is in its greateſt Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction when in exerciſe, for Acts do perfect our Faculties, and when the Soul acts moſt ſweetly and fervently, there is the leaſt Indifferency; for the Efficacy of the Action removes its languid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the ſweetneſs all its fluctuation; and whenever the Will acts, it is determined; for, <hi>Quicquid eſt, quando eſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſario eſt;</hi> and much more determinate it is, when in a State of Giory, acting without Wearineſs and Intermiſſion.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) What is Eſſential to the Soul, is beſt known when in exerciſe about its proper and moſt principal Object; the Eye about Light, the Ear about Sounds, the Intellect about Truth, and the Will about Good. We ſearch the Nature of Sight, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Eye of an Eagle than of an Owl, becauſe it looks on the Sun the principal Object; the other through its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſees with greateſt eaſe in a Twilight. So the Will is to be Conſidered rather as it Acts about its Ultimate End, than about Means; rather about a Chief Good than a Doubtfull Good; rather about God in moſt Clear Viſion, than in this World, where ſo much Darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) That cannot be Eſſential to the Will that is Inconſiſtent with its other Properties in their Perfection, but this Indifferency is inconſiſtent with a previous Judgment, without all Fluctuation or Obſcurity; for what Averſion and Appetite is in the Will, that Affirmation and Negation is in the Intellect, the one bears the ſame reſpect to Good that the other bears to Truth; Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the one, and Indifferency in the other, are both De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That is not Eſſential to the Soul which it deſires to be remov'd, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. <hi>No man ever yet hated his own fleſh:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency is an Impediment and Hinderance to Action, like the waving of the Scales, which is no Principle to, but an Impediment of Action: We Love, <hi>quod facilitat facere,</hi> not what hinders us. Time is conſum'd in Deliberation; Shall I? Shall I? does no Buſineſs: we ſtrive and ſtruggle to come to a Determinateneſs, therefore that muſt be the Perfection, the other a Defect, a Companion of Ignorance and Uncertainty.</p>

(1.) Man would be then an ungovernable Creature, which is a great Abſurdity: for God intended the Care and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Creatures he made, he could not make him Happy or Miſerable in Spirit, if not free his Will, and would he make one that might diſorder his Harmony, and fruſtrate his Deſigns, whether God would or no? (2.) Such a Power in Man would limit an Infinite Being; it would limit his Will, he <hi>worketh all things according to the Counſel of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. The diſtinction has Abſurdity enough in it, of thoſe who ſay 'tis true in Natural things, but not in things Moral. (3.) It limits God's Power as to all Civil Affairs in the World; for ſtill his deſigns muſt depend on the Inclination of Man. (4.) The Knowledge of God: This Concluſion is ſo apparent, for what is uncertain in it ſelf, cannot certainly be known; that <hi>Poieret</hi> denies God's foreknowledge of Sin, and that until it came to paſs, there was not one Thought or Idea of it in God: And <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> denies his Knowledge of Future Contingencies. (5.) It would both rob God of much Praiſe and Glory, and rob poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of much Hope and Comfort: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Doctrine of Perſeverance is undetermined by it: No Perſon could have any Aſſurance from his higheſt Attainments in Grace. <hi>Paul</hi> could not have had any Confidence of God's <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the begun Work</hi> of Grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. if that had been true: Nor <hi>Peter</hi> have concluded God's <hi>eſtabliſhing, ſtrengthning</hi> and <hi>ſettling</hi> the diſperſed <hi>Jews,</hi> from their being called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.

            <p n="5">(5.) The Efficacy of Effectual Calling is aſcribed to the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Divine Influence on the Heart of Man, and not to Man's Will, or the Rethorick of Miniſters: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. that Efficacy is call'd a Powerful, Spiritual <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> there is a tripple Demonſtration; the one is to our Senſe, when we ſee with our Eye, and hear with our Ear; the other is to Reaſon, when the Connection between Terms, or Properties of things are clear and evident; but this third Kind ſeems to be the Lords immediate propoſing clear Apprehenſions of the thing to the Soul of Man, which is called a <hi>speaking to the Heart,</hi> Hoſ. 2.14. <hi>I will allure her, and will sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, There is the Glaſs wherein this Idea is repreſented, which is either the Scripture, as the Mean of Conveyance, or rather the Intellect of Man, becauſe it is by an immediate Efficiency of the Spirit: and the Apoſtle is diſcourſing of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had that Glaſs of the Scripture, but could not receive this Idea into their Minds from it, by reaſon of a Vail on their Minds; they were

So there is a double operation, the firſt is a diſpoſing of the Mind, ſo as theſe Objects may be ſuited to it; for there is no Love but where there is a Likeneſs.

And ſo it is ſaid of every Natural Man, that the things of God are <hi>fooliſhneſs unto them,</hi> and that they cannot diſcern them, becauſe they are <hi>spiritually diſcerned:</hi> But when he is Spiritual, he <hi>diſcerneth all things.</hi> So this ſubjective Influence is the making of a Man Spiritual, which is call'd <hi>a New Creation,</hi> a <hi>Regeneration,</hi> a <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> The third thing is the Author of this Perſwaſion, or of this Image raiſed in the Mind, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> The fourth thing is the infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3 <hi>Prop.</hi> The Will of Man is not free from the Guidance and Conduct of the Underſtanding. <hi>Limborgh</hi> the now great <hi>Cory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> aſſerts the Will of Man after all Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations of the Mind, and fixed Purpoſes of the Judgment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains free to follow thoſe Dictates, or brutally and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to forſake their Conduct by ſuſpenſion, or acting the quite contrary; but the contrary of this has been the Opinion of Ancient Philoſophers, who ſay, <gap reason="foreign">

But, (2.) A greater Authority than Humane aſſerts this Point, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.9. <hi>He that ſaith he is in the light, and hateth his Brother, is in darkneſs even 'till now:</hi> Ch. 4.8. <hi>He that loveth not, knoweth not God:</hi> There the Spirit of God aſſerts the Will, and conſequent Practice neceſſarily to follow an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Underſtanding; and on the contrary, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

(3.) Preaching, Exhortation, Counſel and Advice, would be improper Means for Reforming of Men; the Miniſtry would be an uſeleſs Ordinance, if Men were not guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Underſtandings; for ſuppoſe that Fort was gain'd, nothing at all was gain'd, for the Will would remain in its freedom, whether to be guided by it or no; a Man might be thus ſpiritually a wiſe underſtanding Man, and yet a wicked unconverted Man, but the uſual Phraſe of a wicked Man in Scripture is a <hi>Fool.</hi> (4.) This would allow of another Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Creatures the World has not known, to wit, a Creature with a Free-Will without an Underſtanding; for if they can act ſeparately, they may be ſeparate. (5.) The Unity between the Will and the Underſtanding, they being both the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible Soul, does not admit of the Inclinations of one part contradicting the Inclinations of the other; they are but two different Denominations from different Objects.

We may ſee it in this Inſtance of Hope and Joy; Hope is the Opinion of a future Good in the Underſtanding, Rejoicing is the Diſpoſition of the Will that this Idea or Appearance works: Now is it poſſible for us not to fear on the appearance of a future Evil, or to rejoice on the appearance of a future Good? and what are all theſe Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Paſſions that do variouſly ariſe upon the various ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Good and Bad, but the various Motions of the Will? the Will is the Soul's Inclination, the Soul's Inclination is Love, the Paſſions are Love's different Poſtures, like the variegated Light in the Rain-bow, embracing Beauty fainting under De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Fruition, taking Courage in its wreſtling with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments

               </gap>ll conclude this with theſe two Inferences: 1. That there then was an <hi>Error</hi> or <hi>Miſtake</hi> in the firſt ſin of Angels as well as Man; tho' they had no Outward Tempter, yet their own gliſtering Beauty and glorious Excellencies appearing in their own Mind, were too abſtractly Conſidered, and too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly doted upon. 2. That the <hi>great Object</hi> of our Prayers and Diligence ſhould be to attain true Knowledge. <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing;</hi> we ought daily to Watch at her Gates, <hi>that the Eyes of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding may be enlightened, that we may know what is the Hope of his Calling, and what is the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance;</hi> to know more of God's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that <hi>believe,</hi> to know more of the Beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Vileneſs of ſin, and Vanity of the Creature.</p>
            <p>The fourth Propoſition is, <hi>That the Will of Man is not free to all things:</hi> Every thing is Confin'd to its own Sphere, the Carnal Man to Carnal things, the Spiritual Man <hi>diſcerneth all things,</hi> yet that is Confin'd to ſpirituals here below; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> could Converſe rationally about Heavenly things. This neceſſarily follows from the former Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Will of Man is confin'd to the Underſtanding: Indeed the Appetite is in this ſenſe larger, that it Craves a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Good than the Eye of the Mind can point out to it; but in particular Choice and Proſecution it can only ſeek after ſuch as the Mind demonſtrates to it: <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido;</hi> and it will be further prov'd under the laſt Topick, <hi>viz.</hi> Man's <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Topick, or General Argument for our Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is our Guilt. This is the Argument the Apoſtle inſiſts ſo largely upon, to prove by it, that we are not juſtifi'd by Works, or to render the Goſpel which brings the Tydings of a Juſtification by Faith more acceptable. Firſt, We are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally guilty, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. and we are <hi>by Nature the Children of wrath, even as others;</hi> a Child of Wrath is one liable to Wrath,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50846:41"/> or guilty of Wrath, as <hi>Judas</hi> is called a <hi>Son of Perdition,</hi> Joh. 17.12. And ſo we read of a <hi>Son of Hell,</hi> Mat. 23.15. and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Curſe.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. Deut. 25.2. a <hi>Child of beating,</hi> is tranſlated <hi>worthy to be beaten.</hi> But the great Controverſie is, What is meant by being thus <hi>liable to Wrath by Nature?</hi> There be two ways that they who deny Original Sin explain it: Firſt, ſome ſay it ſignifies only <hi>truly Children of wrath,</hi> as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>By Nature were no Gods. Reſp.</hi> 1. We grant they are truly ſo, but where doth ever the word <hi>Nature</hi> ſignifie no more? For theſe <hi>Gods</hi> wanted a Divine Nature, Spirituality, Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Rule of interpreting Scripture, is to let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word ſignifie as much as it can. 2. The obviated contrary would be ſuch as none ever pretended, <hi>viz.</hi> and were in <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the Children of Wrath even as, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Jews were not in their own Opinion thus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5. A ſecond way is: By <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> Children of Wrath; they found their Interpretations on theſe two things: The Context ſpeaks of their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. The word <hi>Nature</hi> ſignifies ſometimes <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Nature teaches that if a Man have long hair, it is a ſhame unto him. Reſp.</hi> 1. He mentions two kinds of Sins beſide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>viz.</hi> Fleſh and its Luſts, Wills or Deſires, by way of Genealogy ſucceeding one another. 1. Fleſh. 2. Luſts. 3. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation or Fulfillment of them. There are two things here to be proved, That we are <hi>Fleſh</hi> Antecedent to any Cuſtom. 2. To be <hi>Fleſh</hi> is to be ſinful. For the former, ſee <hi>John</hi> 3.3. every thing <hi>born of fleſh</hi> is ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. it's common to Man as Man in this State: — <hi>are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> For the latter, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8, 9. The Apoſtles deſign is to prove, that the Jews were not only as guilty as the Gentiles in Converſation, but in Luſts and fleſhly Diſpoſitions; and ſo naturally Acts are before Cuſtom, but a natural Principle before Acts. It's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before Cuſtom teaches that Leſſon, which brings forth long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more Ornamental Hair in Women than Men; <hi>Rev.</hi> Its a Natural Character of diſtinction of Sexes. 2 Cuſtom is called ſecond Nature; <hi>Like Nature,</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi> Nature; not <hi>Nature ſimply,</hi> and teaches nothing of this Matter: for in ſome Countreys Men nouriſh and dreſs it, in others not; but <hi>Nature</hi> conſtantly diſtinguiſhes; and theſe diſtinguiſhing Characters are called <hi>Nature, Rom.</hi> 1.26, 27.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:50846:41"/>
            <p>Two Ways Nature is moſt uſually taken: (1.) For the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Cauſes, the <hi>Principium, motus,</hi> the Diſpoſition or Conſtituti- of a thing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The Gentiles do by Nature the things of the Law.</hi> Or (2.) for <hi>Birth,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27. The Gentiles are the <hi>uncircumciſion</hi> by Nature, in oppoſition to the Jews, who by Birth had the priviledge of Circumciſion belonging to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. Both theſe are here comprehended, the Arguments for it are theſe: (1.) Fleſh and Nature here ſeem to be one thing; for the reaſon of our being <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> is, becauſe we <hi>had our Converſation in the luſts of the Fleſh</hi> By <hi>Fleſh</hi> in Scripture is underſtood, that Natural byaſs and tendency to Carnal things that is in every Man from his Birth: Hence it's call'd a <hi>fleſhly Mind,</hi> a <hi>Carnal Mind;</hi> and, <hi>in my fleſh dwells no good thing;</hi> and this fleſhly Diſpoſition is Nature to us, for <hi>whatſoever is born of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi> There is <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Fleſh, of which we are born, and then there is this <hi>fleſhly dispoſition,</hi> that is, the property: As it is ſaid, <hi>That what is born of the Spirit is Spirit:</hi> The one is the Holy Ghoſt, the other a Holy Habit in the Mind. So as the Seed of Grace in a Regenerate Man is called the <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> So this <hi>Fleſh</hi> or Carnal Diſpoſition, it is our Corrupt Nature, and it is called <hi>Fleſh</hi> from its oppoſition to the <hi>Spirit:</hi> for as Subſtances, <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are oppoſite in the Scripture, ſo alſo <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Carnal</hi> Diſpoſition; untill a Man hath a higher principle, he only can converſe about Carnal things: Carnal and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are equivalent, <hi>they did partake of your Carnal things:</hi> So <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. The ſtrength of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument lies thus: That ſince by our Birth, and by our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſpoſition, we are <hi>Carnal,</hi> therefore by our Birth and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſpoſition we are liable to Wrath. By our Birth we are <hi>Fleſh, John</hi> 3.3. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh;</hi> and the Text ſays this <hi>Fleſh</hi> renders us liable to Wrath.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We are liable to Wrath from all the ſucceſsful Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Prince of the Air: for all the reſults, ſaith the Context, are <hi>Diſobedience.</hi> Now Satan both can and doth act us before any acquired Cuſtom or Habit; and according to the Common Notions of the Soul, there is no apparent repugnancy why his ſuggeſtions may not be thrown into the Soul, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed too before we are born.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:50846:42"/>(3.) <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> here are oppoſed, as Comprehending the two entire States of Man by Nature; you are <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath,</hi> but <hi>by Grace you are ſaved.</hi> So Nature compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the whole of a Mans Life before Grace, elſe he may be ſav'd without Grace; except <hi>Nature</hi> were taken in this ſenſe, his Argument would be in two conſiderable Points defectible: 1. In ſhewing, as to Eternal Concerns, that by Birth and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Jews and Gentiles condition were alike, as well as by Converſation. 2. In depreſſing the Jews falſe grounded Pride, who reckon'd all the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in a ſinleſs Condition untill adult, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. Is it ſuppoſable, that when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is ſo true, and the latter ſo dangerouſly falſe, and both the Apoſtles deſign in the very place, that there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Argument to ſignifie them, or that when no word more proper than this word <hi>Nature</hi> could be thought on, that that word ſhould be us'd in a moſt improper ſenſe?</p>
            <p>I might add four more to enforce this: 1. Authority. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Proſper</hi> did interpret this Text of Original Sin. 2. Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; the word <hi>Children</hi> is changed, it is not the ſame that in the ſecond is called <hi>Children of Diſobedience,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies our <hi>Birth.</hi> 3. The other Texts of Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. and <hi>Job, I was conceived in Sin, and born in Iniquity: Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> 4. Matter of Fact: Infants dye, ſuffer Miſeries, Pains, that are the Effects of Wrath in Scripture Language, if they were not lyable to them, how ſhould they generally and frequently ſuffer them?</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. We are <hi>perſonally</hi> guilty: To prove that all Men are guilty, is, becauſe the Scripture deſcribing the Heraldry of our Sinfulneſs, doth not derive it from our Actions, but derives the Evil of our Actions from our Perſons. We are <hi>Corrupt trees, and</hi> therefore bring forth <hi>Corrupt fruit.</hi> That <hi>which cometh out of a man defiles a man;</hi> and Satan like, when he ſpeaks <hi>a lye,</hi> ſpeaks <hi>his Own,</hi> John 8 44. If God from a Man's Birth do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine his Will, and ſo ſanctifie him, it may ſtop this Courſe, but being left to himſelf, he cannot but ſin, for Nature will follow its own Courſe. For the Wicked <hi>drink in Iniquity</hi> as the <hi>fiſh do the water; they go aſtray from the Womb, ſpeaking lyes;</hi> and being left to himſelf, as ſoon brings ſhame, as Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves: <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.3, 4. being <hi>evil, ye cannot speak good: — An evil man out of the evil treaſure bringeth forth evil things.</hi> Tit. 1.15.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50846:42"/> 
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that are defil'd every thing is impure:</hi> Prov. 21.4.27. the <hi>plowing</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> of the Wicked are Sins; <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.12. they <hi>defile</hi> whatever they <hi>touch;</hi> the <hi>dead Carkaſs,</hi> and other defiling things under the Law did typifie them. The Nature of God is the Rule of ours, antecedently to his Will, being the Rule of our Actions, and the want of Conformity to the Rule is a Sin, and where the want of his Image is, there is the want of a Likeneſs or Conformity to him; this may be called a <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Guilt,</hi> antecedent to our Guilt by Actions, and is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the former, and much of the ſame Nature with it.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We are <hi>univerſally</hi> Guilty: This is the Apoſtles great and demonſtrative Argument, to prove that we are not juſtified by Works. (1.) He ſuppoſes Salvation poſſible, attainable. (2.) That a Righteouſneſs was neceſſary to it; for the Judge could not be juſt in juſtifying the Unjuſt. (3.) This Righteouſneſs muſt be inherent or imputed; a Righteouſneſs to be <hi>believ'd,</hi> or a Righteouſneſs to be <hi>done</hi> by us; a Righteouſneſs by <hi>Works</hi> or <hi>Faith;</hi> by our own Righteouſneſs, or anothers; by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Righteouſneſs, or Vicarious, what Soveraign Authority in Juſtice might accept in its room; the former is by the Law, the latter is by the Goſpel: the former is that the Apoſtle rejects with moſt induſtrious pains, and ſtrenuous proof. For it's a disjunction that admits of no Medium; if guilty by the Law, only ſav'd by the Goſpel. (4.) He proves, that we are univerſally guilty as to the Law.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Gentiles are, from Chap. 1.18. to Chap. 2.17. <hi>Becauſe they knew God, but did not glorifie him; they detain'd the truth in unrighteouſneſs; they condemn'd in others what they did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Conſcience accus'd them for tranſgreſſing the Law wrote on their minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He proves the Jews guilty, and that in meaſure above the Gentiles, from <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.17. to <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. From their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more Knowledge and worſe Lives, by which they made the Gentiles blaſpheme their Religion, and the Author of it. 2. By doing the ſame things, or things of like Nature, they taught from the Law of God was not to be done. After the obviating of an Objection againſt that Argument, from Ch. 3. to <hi>v.</hi> 9. he there begins a New Argument, to prove all guilty to <hi>v.</hi> 20. by the Authority of the Old Teſtament, the Jews
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50846:43"/> and Chriſtians, only owns the ſtrength of the Argument; but it's Concluſive Univerſality, doth not only prove the Jews are guilty, but all, <hi>v.</hi> 9. both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>None righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, no not one;</hi> v. 19. <hi>All the World guilty before God:</hi> The Citations are ſo interwoven as to guard againſt all Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Negatively, <hi>None righteous;</hi> Poſitively, <hi>All gone out of the way;</hi> Subjectively, underſtanding, <hi>none underſtandeth:</hi> Will; <hi>none ſeeketh after God;</hi> Words, <hi>v.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Their throat is an open Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre,</hi> &amp;c. Works, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood:</hi> Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, againſt Men, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Deſtruction and miſery are in their ways:</hi> Againſt God, <hi>viz. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</hi> Which may ſufficiently diſcover the unreaſonableneſs of their Opinions, who to limit this Guilt, and make ſome room for <hi>Works</hi> in Juſtification, ſay, The Guilt and Works here ſpoken of are only againſt the Ceremonial Law, others againſt the Judicial and Civil Conſtitution of the Jews; others the Moral only, as abſtractly conſider'd from Evangelical, in Strength or Duty: But more of this on <hi>Verſe</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Not only <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally</hi> guilty, but <hi>Numerouſly</hi> guilty: <hi>Every Man</hi> is not only guilty of Sin, but the account of his Sins are Innumerable: For firſt, the Actions of our Life are innumerable, together with the words of our Tongues, and Thoughts of our Mind; and there is a ſinfulneſs accompanying each of theſe. We muſt give an account of every idle word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. and all our Actions are to be ſet before us, and how will then the Sinner be humbled, when his aggravated <hi>Talents,</hi> or Sins, amount to <hi>ten thouſands,</hi> and no coming out till all be paid? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.24, 34. how much more numerous muſt Farthing-Debts be? And yet <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.26. there is <hi>no coming out till the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt farthing</hi> be paid. (2.) God as a Puniſher, or as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner, he reckons the multitude of every Tranſgreſſors Sins great, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. The Deluge was ſent on the Old World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>every thought of the imagination of their Heart was only evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> The Captivity was ſent on the Jews, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.25.51. becauſe their <hi>Whoredoms were encreaſed,</hi> and <hi>ſhe had multiplyed her Abominations more than Samaria:</hi> Nay <hi>Samaria</hi> had not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted half the Sins. When God forgives Sins, he forgives many Sins: <hi>All manner of Sin and Iniquity ſhall be forgiven:</hi> Luke 7.47. <hi>I ſay unto thee, her Sins which are many, ſhall be forgiven,</hi> Rom. 5.16. <hi>The free gift is of many offences unto Juſtification:</hi> James 5.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50846:43"/> and laſt, <hi>He that Converts a Sinner, hides a multitude of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Saints own account of their Sins, or rather Vain At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to account of them, <hi>Job</hi> 9.2, 3. <hi>We cannot anſwer for one of ten thouſand;</hi> ten thouſand was one of the leaſt parcells he could put by their ſelves. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his errors? Cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults.</hi> Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils have compaſſed me about, mine Iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look up: Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.27. One would expect the beſt account of him of any body, if he ſhould lay out his Talent of Wiſdom that Way, which after he became a Penitent, or one gathered into the Church, as the Hebrew Phraſe is, he did; for Verſe 25. he ſays, <hi>I applied my Heart to know the wickedneſs of folly, even of Wickedneſs and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> Ver. 27. he ſays, <hi>This he had found, counting one by one, to find out the account, which yet my Soul,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſeeketh, but I find not.</hi> That is, he found the account of Sin was not to be found out; but this he found, <hi>Verſe</hi> 29. that <hi>they were many,</hi> they had <hi>ſought out many inventions,</hi> and that God was Author to none of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Similitudes they are compared with, the <hi>Hains of our head,</hi> Pſal. 40.12. the <hi>drops</hi> of a living <hi>Spring,</hi> the <hi>Sand on the Sea-ſhore,</hi> as the words of <hi>Manaſſehs</hi> Prayer hath it. The very Tongue it ſelf, ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> is a <hi>World of Iniquity;</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of Sin are <hi>high as Heaven,</hi> Ezra 9.6. <hi>Deep as Hell,</hi> Hoſ. 9.9. Pſal. 130.1. Its <hi>Breadth</hi> and <hi>length</hi> are ſuch as nothing but the Incomprehenſible heighth, depth, length and breadth of the Love of Chriſt can cover.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may know the Number of our Sins by the Books of Accounts, that the great Auditor of Accounts Chriſt Jeſus will make uſe of at the great day: There is the Book of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that contains the Law, and ſo teaches us Skill in this Holy Arithmetiek; the ſecond is the Book of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is like our Diary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. and has all Matter of Fact wrote in it: By comparing theſe together, every Man may get ſight of a huge and terrible Number of Sins. Firſt for the Law, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad; but yet there is an oppoſite <hi>Law in our Members,</hi> that is as broad as it; for there is no Law but we have ſome way or other broken, and that by a nigher Tranſgreſſion than by that Rule the Apoſtle gives; he that <hi>tranſgreſſes one is guilty of all:</hi> This Law has a famous Diviſion in <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> but the Jews ſubdivide them into 613 Ceremonial and Judicial Precepts,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50846:44"/> and ſo may we in as many particular Moral ones: As for Inſtance, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> Comprehends our <hi>Faith</hi> in God and all his Promiſes; and who can reckon the number of Promiſes, Bleſſings? Secondly, <hi>Knowledge</hi> and Study of God; and who can reckon the various parts of Divinity? Thirdly, <hi>Love</hi> of God, and this ſhould be as much repeated as his Mercies are to us, that admit of no Intermiſſion. Fourthly, <hi>Adoration,</hi> and this admits as many parts as there are things unknown of the Incomprehenſible God, or as there are New Diſcoveries made of them. Fifthly, <hi>Obedience,</hi> and this is as large as all particular Precepts: Sixthly, Farther, if we ſhall take one of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Commands, they admit of Variety of Kinds of Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt them; for Inſtance, <hi>Adoration,</hi> Atheiſm, Idolatry, Magick, Superſtition, Blaſphemy, Hypocriſie, are all Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of that Duty; and yet there is none of theſe Species of Sins, but may be ſubdivided into multitude of Inferior Branches. For Inſtance; Idolatry; Men have been as many ways guilty of it as there are Creatures, the very Mouſe has been Worſhipped, and Art has been put on the Rack for Invention of Kinds of Molten, Carved, Painted Idols, or Images: There has been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Idols, for all the Ends or Uſes Man wanted any good: There has been Gods of Sneezing, there has been as many Idols as there are things that Men ſet their Hearts too much upon Profits, Pleaſures, Honours. If we will next take the other Book of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and ſearch how often we commit Idolatry with what is our Idol, which by our practice we perpetually purſue; We talk on it, we think on it, we dream on it; who can then reckon the multitude of his Tranſgreſſions? If our Conſciences be ſecure, and we reckon our ſelves pretty Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from groſs abominable Sins, yet this Number might ſtartle us; there are multitudes, <hi>Multitudes in the Valley of Deciſion.</hi> We cannot but ſay, <hi>Beelzebubs</hi> Sin was the greateſt Sin in the World, yet we dare not ſay 'twas greater than the Sins of all the reſt that Complied with him; for they loſt God, a vaſt number of Creatures, and threw Dirt on multitudes of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Images: So thy many Sins have robbed God of many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Beſide, in the number of our Sins there is not only a bare encreaſe of Quantity, but there is encreaſe of Intention with their Extenſion: As Poyſon, or Phyſick, five Grains at one time will work more than four Grains at two times: So we find,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50846:44"/> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.22. <hi>Peter</hi> thought <hi>eight times</hi> was unpardonable; and the Lord ſays, <hi>Numbers</hi> 14.22. Becauſe they had <hi>ten times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled,</hi> they ſhould none of them <hi>enter into the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſtant <hi>Multiplication</hi> of Sin has a Continuedneſs of Sin in it, and this is highly provoking to God: As Continued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Prayer prevails with him for Bleſſings, Continuedneſs in ſinning provokes him to Anger.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We are <hi>hainouſly guilty.</hi> This accompanies every Sin, its a property of its Nature, thô few ſee it. When the Apoſtle had his eyes open to ſee it, the ſight ſtruck him dead: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>When Sin revived, I dy'd:</hi> The Effects of it diſcovers this, it debaſes the Soul to ſlave on Earth, and live on Husks; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files the Soul ſo, that no Nitre can waſh it clean; it made the Angels who ſparkled like <hi>Morning-ſtars,</hi> fall to the ground like a ſhot, ſpent Meteor: It diſorder'd Divine Government, eclips'd his Glory, deſtroy'd his Imnge; it ruin'd this World, and laid the Foundation of Hell. It's the Root and Abſtract of all other Evils; they live and move by it, they all ſerve to give it Names, it's Poyſon, Vomit, Mire, Darkneſs, Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Folly, Madneſs, Death, Poverty, Shame and Nakedneſs. God glories to be the Author of all things, but abhorrs this as a Baſtard, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. never had any hand in its production. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt glories that he has born all Evil, that he was able and willing to drink the Curſed dregs out of the Cup of our Afflictions, but he would never taſte of this. The Saints who but ſee it's Evil as with one Eye, through a Cranny, prefer the bittereſt of Sufferings to the pleaſures of Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. She that <hi>liveth in pleaſure, is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi> The Devil is not worſe than Sin has made him; there is no Evil in him but Sin and it's Fruits. The Divine Attributes have Variety of Objects, but Wrath, Hatred is all engroſs'd on this one Object <hi>Sin,</hi> and there it acts with ſuch Vigour, as that where it is only imputed, and the Perſon his <hi>only begotten</hi> Son, he will not ſpare him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. And its Evil is ſeen more in its being as contrary to God, as God is to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. It's againſt his Exiſtence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. it hates him, wiſhes he were not; it's againſt all his Attributes, all his Laws, all his Favourites. We cannot ſay it's as <hi>bad</hi> as God is <hi>good,</hi> becauſe he can forgive it, ruin it, ſanctifie from it; but as he is <hi>only</hi> good, it is <hi>only</hi> evil; he is to be Loved for himſelf, it is to be Hated for it ſelf;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50846:45"/> and by being againſt him directly and only: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned;</hi> it puts on an <hi>Infiniteneſs</hi> of Evil, Acts being denominate from their Objects: So we have a twofold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs in Sin: The <hi>Number</hi> of Sin, and the <hi>Nature</hi> of Sin. No wonder there needed an Infiniteneſs in the Ranſom.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There are great Aggravations accompany the guilt of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sinner, beſide the Eſſential Hainouſneſs of every Sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the particular aggravations that diſtinguiſhes one Sinner from another; there are three Circumſtances that much ſwell the guilt of ſin, as a tripple addition of Venom to a Toad, that no adult Perſons want in ſome degree. (1.) Sin againſt <hi>Knowledge,</hi> Luke 12.47. of this Pagans were guilty: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18, 21. (2.) Againſt <hi>Mercies;</hi> of this the Pagans were guilty too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. and 2.4, 5. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. Formation in the Womb, Integrity of Mind, Senſes and Members, ſafe Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a furniſh'd World to come into, a time of Reprieve, and ſpace of Repentance to ſtay in it. (3.) <hi>Voluntarineſs,</hi> bent of Mind: Some would have an Indifferency neceſſary to the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs that makes Man guilty, and what wants this, is no guilt: A Drunken Mans Murder is no ſin in their ſenſe, nor an Infants Inclinations, Paſſions no ſins, nor an Adults thoughts, except the prevalency and conſent of the Will be to it; but this is very contrary to Scripture: For (1.) It makes <hi>Luſt</hi> a Sin, which is an Inclination before an Act. (2.) The Apoſtle owns ſin where the <hi>I</hi> or prevalent <hi>Will</hi> is not: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 17, 18. <hi>Not I, but Sin in me.</hi> (3.) It makes <hi>willingly</hi> an Aggravation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28, 32. (4.) If there are Sins of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> there are Sins without Free-will, for no Freewill without Knowledge. (5.) We are <hi>Originally Guilty,</hi> but the Apoſtle leaving this indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly out of his Argument, in the firſt, ſecond, and third Chapter, and treating of it in the Fifth Chapter, by it ſelf, I ſhall omit, and paſs to the laſt Topick.</p>
            <p>I come to the fourth and laſt Argument, to prove that Man has no Matter of Glorying before God, and that is from his Impotency of doing any good; as he is guilty by ſinning for the time paſt, ſo it is not in his Power to abſtain from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtill: And this Impotency is two-fold, Natural and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Moral Impotency is an Averſion and Antipathy in the Will from a thing, but a Natural Impotency is a Defect in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50846:45"/> ſome other Faculty that hinders the Action; <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2. the Leper ſays, <hi>Lord, if thou wilt thou canſt make me clean:</hi> He doubts not the Natural but the Moral Power. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren they hated <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and could not ſpeak peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, the Defect of Power was in the Will, not in the Tongue. That there is this Moral Impotency in Man to any Spiritual Good, is generally granted amongſt Proteſtants, and is founded upon theſe reaſonable grounds: (1.) Becauſe the Scripture lays our Diſobedience at the Door of our Wills, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>You will not come unto me that you might have Life: How often would I have gathered you, but you would not.</hi> (2.) Becauſe the Scripture calls this Impotency an <hi>Enmity, Romans</hi> 8.7. <hi>The Carnal Mind is enmity againſt God, therefore it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be:</hi> So <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.7. The Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſays of the Friend, that <hi>the Children were in Bed, and he could not riſe:</hi> And another Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. ſays of the ſeveral Rejecters of Chriſt, <hi>That they could not receive him; I have Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Wife, and therefore cannot come.</hi> (3.) Chriſt tells the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> that they had a Natural Power to know that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> becauſe they imployed it about other things that Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more Skill to know them: <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Ye can diſcern the Face of the Skye, can ye not diſcern the Signs of the Times?</hi> (4) This Impotency towards Holineſs is like the Impotency in God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinning, but that is only a Moral Impotency; for Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency is Uncapable of a Natural Weakneſs, <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and canſt not look on Iniquity:</hi> Titus 1.2. <hi>God that cannot lye:</hi> This Impotency is a high Perfection, and when the Saints are Regenerate in a likeneſs to God, they partake of this Averſion to Sin alſo: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God doth not Commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin.</hi> A Potency to ſin is an Imperfection, but an Impotency by which one cannot forbear ſinning is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Perfection that can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. (5.) Our Natural Indiſpoſition or Natural impotency is a farther Proof of this, for things are gratefull or ungratefull to our Taſte, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Diſpoſition of our Palat. Our Will is our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Appetite, and according to its Natural Diſpoſition its Sympathy or Antipathy ariſes. We are a Generation of Vipers, there is Poyſon in our Conſtitution, and <hi>being evil we cannot ſpeak good;</hi> Mat. 7.18. <hi>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50846:46"/> can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</hi> This Indiſpoſition is granted both by <hi>Arminians</hi> and their Antagoniſts, but the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between them, is, Whether 'tis a Sin or no. The Divine Nature in Holineſs, Righteouſneſs and Knowledge, is as much the Meaſure and the Rule of the Diſpoſition of the Mind of Man, as the Divine Law, which is the Copy of that Holy Nature, is the Rule and Meaſure of Mans Actions; and therefore ſince Sin is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Want of Conformity to the Law, there is a ſinfulneſs in our very Natures, though undoubtedly it wants much of the Sinfulneſs and Guilt that our actual Tranſgreſſions have; the one is our Miſery and our Grief, the other is Matter of our Repentance and Amendment: It ſeems to receive a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution in that 5th. of <hi>Romans,</hi> that they have not ſinned after the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Scripture elſewhere aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the Sins of Adult Perſons, ſays, <hi>They have Tranſgreſſed like Men,</hi> but the Original hath it, <hi>like Adam.</hi> This Moral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency is as unconquerable as Natural Antipathies, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.25. <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> The Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents a Penetration of Dimenſions, which is beyond a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, to be eaſier than for an Unregenerate Man to mortifie his Earthly Inclinations. Tranſubſtantiation is eaſier to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, than that a Man can Convert himſelf when he will, tho' receiving all External Helps; for in this young Man here was a good Natural Diſpoſition, <hi>Jeſus loved him;</hi> here was a good Education, <hi>All theſe have I obſerved from my Youth;</hi> here was an excellent Preacher, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; here was a Carefull Attention, for <hi>he went away grieved</hi> at the Propoſal of the Choice; Chriſt offered him Treaſure in Heaven for parting with Treaſure on Earth, but that he could not do. Laſtly, Becauſe the Scripture aſſerts, that we are made Willing by Divine Power, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No Man can come to me except the Father draw him:</hi> Pſal. 110. <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power:</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5. <hi>Our Goſpel came not to you in Word only, but alſo in power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a Natural Impotency as well as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. (1.) Becauſe this Impotency is in our Natural Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me.</hi> Neither the Grammar, nor Senſe gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Context, will allow <hi>David</hi> to be bemoaning here his Parents Tranſgreſſion, for that could not make up a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50846:46"/> part of his Repentance; and here <hi>David</hi> doth oppoſe it unto that Truth that God deſired in the hidden and inward Parts of Man: <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> If the Firſt fruit be Holy, ſo is the Lump, if the Root be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo are the Branches. We are by Nature <hi>the Children of Wrath;</hi> read <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. and 12.34. Since this Averſeneſs is born with us, Univerſal to all, I think it may be call'd Natural, tho' in the Will, ſo the Moral Impotency is Natural. (2.) The more Moral Impotency that a Man is under, the more Guilty he is: But there is an Impotency in Man to good, that in ſome part, tho' not wholly, doth excuſe Guilt, as the Infants in <hi>Nineve.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>All dye, becauſe all have ſinned,</hi> but none can be ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable towards Poor Infants, whoſe Impotency is greater than the Adult's, to think that therefore they are more guilty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. (3.) The Invincibleneſs and Unconquerableneſs of this Impotency being repreſented under ſuch an utter Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, doth manifeſt a Defect in all the other Powers as well as the Will, as impoſſible as for a great Camel to go thorough the Eye of a Needle; it requires as great a Power as Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Reſurrection of one from the Dead doth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. it requires the <hi>exceeding greatneſs of his Power,</hi> the Energy of his mighty Power. If all the other Faculties were fitted for their Office, eſpecially the Underſtanding, it might and would ſway the Will, ſince the Will follows its Conduct, as is prov'd before; for the Goſpel propoſes ſuch Objects with ſuch a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that would ſurely Captivate and Conquer the Will, if there were no Defect in diſcerning it; and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle complains of the Defect of other Powers; <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not.</hi> Chriſt blames the Diſciples for the Weakneſs of the Fleſh, when the Spirit was willing: Suppoſe our Wills intire, our Animal Spirits would not ſerve us to Obey the Law of Innocency, and this Incapacity is from our ſin; ſo a Man is as Guilty by this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, as in Omiſſions of Duty thorough Drunkenneſs, and I cannot think but a Man is Guilty of Blood that Kills his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in Drink, or doth not deliver him ſinking in the Water, becauſe his Drunkenneſs has made him uncapable, the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is voluntarily Contracted: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would:</hi> Was there no Sin in the Impotence, ſince they were willing?
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50846:47"/> (4.) The Underſtanding is a diſtinct Power from the Will, and antecedent in Manner of working, and there is an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency aſcrib'd to it; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The Natural Man cannot know ſpiritual things. The Contrivance of our Salvation, which is the Effect and Glory of Divine Wiſdom, appear'd to the Grecian Philoſophers ſeriouſly Studying the Caſe, a ridiculous Dream of a weak Brain. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.19. The <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Philoſophers, tho' they heard him again and again, and tho' his Speech was Divine, yet the Concluſion was Laughter and Mockery: Reſurrection of the Dead was a ſtrange and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Doctrine to Pagans; Heaven and Hell, a Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Deſtruction of this World, were Chimera's and Fancies: <hi>Caecil</hi> the Philoſopher thus: <q>O wonderful Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and incredible Boldneſs! they Contemn preſent Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and yet fear future Pains; they fear not Death, but fear to dye after Death; their Fear is fooliſh, and their Hope fallacious of Comfort at the revival from Death, for they are not Contented with the furious Opinion of the Diſſolution of the World, threatning the very Stars with Fire, but they tell old Fables of a Birth after Death from the Cinders and Aſhes.</q> 
               <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Galileans</hi> were Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Perſons, who willingly choſe Death from Hopes of good things afterward. Chriſtianity appears as fooliſh to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt is to them a Caſtle in the Air: When <hi>Pilat, John</hi> 18. heard that Chriſt's Kingdom was not in this World, he thought it was not worth his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſome imaginary Buſineſs: Nor had the Vulgar any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. they would follow him for Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bread, and Crown him for it, but they could not reliſh his Diſcourſe of Heavenly Bread. The <hi>Pagans</hi> us'd to call them Atheiſts, becauſe they had no Temples, Altars, Sacrifices, nor Holy Dayes; an inward Religion in Thoughts was no Religion to them, their groſs Minds could not feel it; and they us'd to throw their Aſhes in the Rivers, thinking thereby to prevent their Reſurrection. An Univerſal Monarch from among the <hi>Jews</hi> was no credible Doctrine to a <hi>Roman,</hi> whoſe Subjects or Slaves they were, far leſs to believe him a God and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, one rejected by the <hi>Jews,</hi> Mock'd, Scourg'd and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifi'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> who enjoy'd Divine Oracles, eſpecially the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50846:47"/> ones of ſuch a Prince and Saviour, yet how contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible was the Obſcurity of his Life! And what offence was the Croſs of his Death to them? and how fooliſh did his Doctrine appear, <hi>John</hi> 7. 49! His holy Laws about Loving our Enemies ſeem'd impoſſible to practice, and contrary to Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in the Opinion of both Jew and Gentile: Regeneration was a Miracle to a ſerious <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> On theſe Examples, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that <hi>Act.</hi> 17. the Apoſtle ſeems to reflect in that Aſſertion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. But ſecondly, the Scripture is moſt frequent and emphatical in this Aſſertion, that the Underſtanding, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17. is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Dark: <hi>We are in darkneſs;</hi> but more is ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>We are darkneſs.</hi> Some Creatures can ſee in the dark, that carry a light about with them; but we are dark, yea darkneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41. therefore <hi>cannot believe this Work, thô a man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it unto us:</hi> And there is not only Darkneſs, or ſome Vail over the Eye, or defect in it, but it is expreſs'd by the want of Eyes, Ears, and Underſtanding too as to this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.4. <hi>An heart to perceive, eyes to ſee:</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. <hi>And hath given us an underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Fleſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Fleſh and Blood hath not reveal'd it;</hi> Fleſhly Wiſdom, carnally minded, becauſe it can only diſcern Earthly things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sick, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Corrupt minds;</hi> the word ſignifies <hi>ſickly,</hi> but how? by being <hi>deſtitute of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Weak, Impotent; <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think a right thought.</hi> The evil of our Thoughts proceed from the weakneſs of the Mind; there was weakneſs before Sin: <hi>Eve</hi> was deceiv'd, beguil'd, much more ſince Sin. I might form an Argument thus: The Underſtanding is a diſtinct Power or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty from the Will, but there is an Impotence in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; therefore there is a Natural Impotency, for a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Impotence is an Impotence in another Faculty than the Will: <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.5. <hi>The Wiſdom of a Man is his ſtrength.</hi> If a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had the ſtrength of an Ox, and Courage of a Lyon, what ſerves it for without Wiſdom? therefore Ignorance is weakneſs; to be Carnally minded is to be weak: <hi>The weapons of our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare are not carnal, but mighty.</hi> There is great Reaſon we ſhould believe the Scripture in this Point, becauſe the Eye cannot ſee it ſelf, and the moſt Ignorant Man thinks he is knowing. The blind Phariſees ſaid, <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.19. they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50846:48"/> were confident they were ſufficient Guides to the Blind. A Fool, a Madman thinks himſelf Wiſe; God has given us this Glaſs to ſee our Minds in, and undeceive our ſelves. Further,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Scripture aſſerts, That the Common Profeſſion of Chriſtianity on an Hiſtorical Faith, is a Gift of the Spirit: <hi>No Man can call Jeſus Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> All thoſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Politicians before mention'd, could not ſee grounds of embracing him until this Gift was given: The ſpreading of Deiſm at this time is a great and ſad ſign of the withdrawing of theſe gifts. The Proteſtant Profeſſion ſprung out of Popery by ſuch a Light: Nay,</p>
            <p n="6">6. Natural Religion is a Divine Gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. and 2.25. <hi>God manifeſts himſelf, he writes his Laws on our hearts.</hi> Since we ſee ſome born Fools and Ideots, all might be; <hi>Neither for this mans ſin nor his Parents ſin was he born blind;</hi> therefore if for any, it was for Sin common to the whole of Mankind. Now the Scripture ſhews what makes the difference, <hi>John</hi> 1. He is <hi>the Light that enlightens every one that comes into the World; he has Gifts for the Rebellious,</hi> Pſal. 68.18. No Man is ſo bad as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The skill of Plowing, Sowing, Trading, are from God: <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.24. it is both fully and clearly aſſerted. If then Man by Nature is weak as to theſe, how much more as to Saving Knowledge, the leaſt Grain whereof, if like a Muſtard-ſeed, initiates in the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.31. the very Smoke of it is preferable to the Light of moſt ſparkling Gifts, for it will never be quenched. It is ſpecifically diſtinct from other Knowledge of Scripture by Gift or Acquirement; the one is, to uſe the Schoolmen's Language, <hi>Specie Propriâ,</hi> the other is, <hi>Specie Aliena;</hi> by the one we only know the ſigns of Divine things, by the other, the things themſelves, (or rather in my weak Thought) a more like or nigher Idea of them fram'd by God himſelf; the one is like the ſight of a Picture, the other is like the Perſon; the one like an Anatomy by Book, the other by immediate Diſſection; one like Learning by an Herbal Book, the other by Simpling, taſting of Meat, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling another of it: The two Perſons Thoughts much differ. <hi>Job</hi> ſays, <hi>I have heard, now I ſee,</hi> Ch. 42. <hi>v.</hi> 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17, 21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20.</p>
            <p>I can imagine nothing that can be Objected againſt this but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50846:48"/> one of theſe three. 1 <hi>Obj.</hi> If a Man's Will were right, he could do good enough, and be happy enough without this Knowledge. <hi>Reſp.</hi> One may as well think a Watch can go without the Spring, for the Underſtanding is the Guide; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Not by fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God.</hi> According to the kind of Knowledge, Gracious or Fleſhly, ſo the Converſation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Luſts of the mind</hi> might be Engliſh'd <hi>Wills of reaſoning:</hi> The Will follows that, but that being Corrupt, the Will is a Luſt. 2 <hi>Obj.</hi> If we had a true Will for this Knowledge, we ſhould have it. <hi>Reſp.</hi> Not by pains, for it's the Work of the Spirit, nor by Promiſe, for we have generally a deſire for Knowledge, we would be as wiſe as Angels; we have an earneſt deſire for more skill in our Employs and Callings, and as to ſaving Knowledge God gives to whom, and when he will. 3 <hi>Obj.</hi> If we have a Will for it, God accepts the Will for the Deed. <hi>Reſp.</hi> This Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om admits of Limitation, for it could not be admitted by the Law of Innocence, it's only under the Goſpel Conſtitution, it's on Chriſt's Account the Will is accepted for the Deed; that is, thrô him the Defect and Imperfection is pardoned: The want of the Deed is then a Sin, it needs a Pardon: So there is a Sin, the Will being ſuppos'd right; <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Ye cannot do the things that ye would,</hi> Gal. 5.17. A ſecond Limitation is, that the Will is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>according to what a Man hath;</hi> he muſt do what he can, elſe the Will will not be accepted for the reſt. From theſe Texts the fault is not laid on the weak degree of the Will, but on other Powers.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Argument for Natural Impotence, is from the One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Unitedneſs of Soul. The Soul is a Natural principle in the Man, and there is Impotence in every part therefore if in one: If Impotence in the Will is call'd Moral from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Will being ſo, why not Natural by being in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or whole Soul? If that be Natural which is born with us, this Impotence is ſo: If the Texture and Frame of Eſſential Properties be Nature, as we ſay Nature will do the Cure, Nature is ſtrong or weak, this is Natural; if that be Natural which is Univerſal, this is ſo, Univerſal in every Man, and part of Man; if all be polluted, all is weak, Sin is a Ruſt and Duſt in the Wheels, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>All under Sin,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50846:49"/> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Soul, Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> need Sanctification: Spirit is Judgment, Conſcience: and Soul, Affections or Paſſions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. Soul and Spirit are compar'd to Joynts and Marrow, the Animal Spirits are ſeated in the Marrow; but groſs Joynts and Bones of the Body are without: from this Oneneſs of the Soul, the Argument for Moral Impotence alone appears ſtrong; if a Mans Will were right all were right: This is true, becauſe it cannot be ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or cured alone: It is as true, if a Mans Underſtanding were Cur'd, all were Cur'd, therefore its Cure is reckon'd the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Mercy: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. It's the ſumm of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8, 14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. to open <hi>their Eyes, and turn them from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> is the ſumm of the Goſpel. It's the ſumm of the Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>They ſhall all know me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſixth Argument for Natural Impotency, is from the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Potency</hi> over our Souls; he uſes a Natural or Phyſical Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to hinder our Converſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. he works <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> with an Energy, and there is need of ſuch an Energy to remove him and his influence: Moral Swaſion will not Chain Satan; he would become very good, if perſwaſion would make him leave off tempting: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. He that <hi>wrought effectually</hi> in <hi>Peter —the ſame was mighty in me.</hi> Before Man's Fall Satan ſtood without, and uſed only Moral Swaſion, which Man could have reſiſted and diſſented from; but now his Operation is of a ſuperior Kind than by Humane Converſe: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. its call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heavenly, <hi>We wreſtle againſt wicked Spirits in heavenly's;</hi> ſo the Marginal reading is: the Text ſhows its the manner of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is call'd <hi>heavenly,</hi> as well as the ſubject, about which he ſits on the Imagination, as a Spider on his Web, he can bridle our ruling Faculties as a Man a Horſe, and ſpur him in the moſt tender and unguarded part, as a Mans way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is ſuperiour to that of a Horſe, another Horſe cannot do ſo; ſo Satan is in a ſuperior Order and Rank of Creatures to us, he knows where our Helm ſtands, and can lay his hand upon it, and turn us at pleaſure; we may ſee it in <hi>Lunaticks,</hi> whom the Scripture calls <hi>poſſeſs d,</hi> and yet Poſſeſſion is a more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal way, affecting more the <hi>Body:</hi> for I believe poſſeſs'd Perſons may be in a State of Grace; it's more an Affliction and Puniſhment than a Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Satan has the <hi>Power of death,</hi> Heb. 2.14. for any thing I know that Scripture intimates, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50846:49"/> he has an active Influence on the Death of every Man: We call it a <hi>Natural Death,</hi> but it is the Devil, with as active Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, as if the Executioner cut our Throat: And if Man could reſiſt him either in puniſhing Soul or Body, he were not a fit Executioner of Divine Wrath: Tho' his influence is inferior to the Operation of the Holy Spirit; for <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12, 13. in the <hi>power of his might</hi> we can reſiſt him, tho' in that only; and tho' Temptation is by way of preſenting Objects, yet ſince he is a powerful Spirit, abides and works within us, we cannot limit it to Objective Influence, nor deny all Phyſical Influence to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſince Satan can even paint them upon the Imagination, and from thence throw his Bombs into the very Soul, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our attending any thing that may divert our Thoughts. If one more ſtrong than I ſet an Object before my Eye or Ear, and keep my Eye-lids open, or not ſuffer me to ſtop my Ear, I cannot prevent the Influence of the Object, it's got within the guards; but when Satan is in our imagination, he is much nigher and intimate.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Naturalneſs</hi> of this Impotency may be drawn from the Object, or neceſſary Way of Divine Operation in Curing this Diſtemper; which is by preſenting the true Image of God and Divine things to the Underſtanding, before ever the Will can be affected with them: If the Free-will of Man were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as high as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> would have it, that is, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the leaſt crack or flaw from Man's Fall, it's Power is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to admit or reject, chooſe or refuſe what's brought within it's ken, or what Objects are propoſed in the Underſtanding: Now no Man can have any Knowledge of heavenly things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Heavenly Being propoſeth the Idea of them to the Mind: No Man can learn any thing by meer words, and thoſe Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical too, and ſuch are the Scriptural Expreſſions of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. Our Mind muſt be ſome way acquainted with the thing it ſelf before it can know it: A Book cannot make a Man an Aſtronomer without his Globe, nor the Globe either without an immediate contemplating the Stars: If a Traveller had learnt his Geographical Map with the greateſt Accuracy and Exactneſs, he finds his Idea of the Countrey a meer miſtake, as ſoon as he views it with his Eye: God has made our Souls a Mirror, wherein his own Image may be repreſented as a Looking-glaſs; Water, or poliſhed Braſs repreſents the Image of Bodies, but
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50846:50"/> they can never do it except the Perſon immediately approach before them: So God muſt draw nigh to the Soul before it can diſcern him: He by his preſence produces his own likeneſs on the Soul; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 17.15. <hi>When I ſhall awake, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs: David</hi> knew this by ſome earneſt of it; this made his Soul pant and thirſt ſo for it under the want of it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.2. <hi>My Soul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before him</hi> This Likeneſs, or Spiritual Image is what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much travelled for, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Of whom I travel in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you:</hi> For it ſeems to be the Knowledge of Chriſt, from <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. <hi>After that ye have known God, or rather are known of God.</hi> Our Knowledge ſaith that Text is more paſſive than active, to wit, an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Idea, and this Idea is Chriſt form'd objectively with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or his Glorious Image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. not excluding, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſequentially to it, a likeneſs of the Soul to Chriſt in Holy Qualities: As that Text has it, <hi>Beholding his glory we are transformed into the ſame Image.</hi> Without this the Soul is as a Carkaſs forſaken of the Soul as to Spirituals: To <hi>be carnally minded is death;</hi> as the dark and doleſome Air forſaken of the Sun, or as the ſtinking Lanthorn, when the flame is extinct; both theſe laſt Arguments are mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 8.43. <hi>Why do ye not underſtand my Speech? becauſe ye cannot hear my Word, ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi> 1. A Denyal of the Act, <hi>Ye do not underſtand my Sermons or Diſcourſes:</hi> 2. A denyal of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <hi>Ye cannot.</hi> 3. The Power of Learning is deny'd, that is the power of Underſtanding: For Hearers are Learners: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>He that hath an Ear, let him hear:</hi> they wanted the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty repreſented by the Organ; <hi>Therefore speak I to them in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, becauſe ſeeing, they ſee not, and hearing they hear not, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi> 4.

A further Reaſon why the Truths of the Goſpel are an unintelligible Object to an other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe intelligent Creature, is, <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil;</hi> the powers of Darkneſs have begotten this Darkneſs and Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that makes up the Conſtitution of thy Soul: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that believe not,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50846:50"/> leaſt the light of the glorious Gospel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> Pſal. 89.15. <hi>Bleſſed are the people who know the joyful ſound, they walk in the light of thy Countenance, O Lord.</hi> For there is this freedom from Satan, who like a Father propagates an heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſtemper of Darkneſs and Hatred about heavenly things in the Soul of his Children; and this Diſtemper is our Natural Temper, thrô it we are by Nature Children of Wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, As the Averſeneſs of our Will is a Moral Impotency, and the darkneſs of our underſtandings a Natural Impotency, ſo I may add an Habitual Impotency, that in Adult Perſons hardens and ſtrengthens both; and this habit has a threefold Spring that feeds it, or a threefold Cord that Chains and Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the Soul; <hi>Education, Cuſtom,</hi> and <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Education; the Soul of Man is a Chamber of Imagery, and as ſoon as it comes into being, God, or the Devil, or our Senſes by their Objects conſtantly fill it: and he that takes the ſtart, has the greateſt advantage, and eaſieſt work, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Child in the way that he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi> The ſooner Parents begin, the more acceptable to God, and the Impreſſions ſtick the deeper: There is the more room for them, it becomes a Veſſel of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Diſhonour, according as Inſtructers fill it: If we are ſo impotent to good, that we cannot Conquer any one of thoſe acquired Impediments of Cuſtom, Company, and Education, which might properly be call'd <hi>Moral</hi> Impotence, and both the other <hi>Natural;</hi> how much leſs when we are Chained to Evil by all of 'em, and when they have the Power of Hell to back them, and when they are but as Twigs, or ſmall Grafts from that bulky Stock of our Natural Corruption? and if ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to good, how little reaſon of Glorying over what good we find in us, or aſcribing any part of it to our ſelves. If you will ſeem to ſet a value on a Rattle, a Child will preferr it to Gold: If you will act fear at the ſight of a Friend, the Child will cry. <hi>Carteſius</hi> complains of the great Impediments in our Progreſs in Philoſophy by Childiſh prejudices from Education; they do much more injury to Religion; few Parents can inſtruct their Children, and far fewer doe it. How few can give any reaſon for their being Diſſenters, or Conformiſts, Proteſtants or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Chriſtians, Mahometans or Pagans, but their Education,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50846:51"/> their Parents or their Maſters firſt taught them ſo: This is a very ill Foundation for Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cuſtom: <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do evil:</hi> There is a kind of Moral Impoſſibility in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cuſtom; the Doctrines of Popery in this Nation and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were more eaſily reformed than Cuſtoms; it's Carnivals, May-poles, Holy-days, Altars, Rails, Croſſings and Kneelings with Sacred Veſtures, and other Rights, are all kept by the power of Cuſtom; the Learning of Synods, nor the Wiſdom or Powers of Parliaments have not been ſufficient to conquer Cuſtom in ſuch trivial and indifferent things: A Cuſtom in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, impowers a Man mightily in Religion, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any Man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine:</hi> If he will but attempt to practiſe, and make experiment, he ſhall ſoon become a thriving Chriſtian, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.100. <hi>I underſtand more than the Ancients, becauſe I keep thy Precepts.</hi> By the ſtart of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice he ſoon outſtript his Teachers in Knowledge: <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 14. they were dull in hearing, becauſe they did not uſe their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſes; but Cuſtom of doing Evil grows faſter than the other, becauſe it is engrafted upon our Inclination, and our Inclination is the Stump from the Root of our Nature. Our Converſation is from our Luſts, and our Luſts from our Fleſh. Men proud and ambitious, can never learn the Doctrine of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Self-denyal, or the Croſs: Charity and Liberality are Paradoxes to the Covetous, and all reveal'd Religion a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Prophane. Heaven is a Dream to the Earthly Worm, and he will as ſoon forſake the one for the other, as his Life. The</p>

And laſt, is Company; <hi>Evil Company corrupts good manners.</hi> A Man can never maintain Converſe, but with Perſons ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Inclination, or to whoſe Humours he forms and ſuits his own. The Penal Laws of Cities or Nations, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Maſters or Parents, are not of ſo great Influence as what is valuable and faſhionable in the Society we live in. In a School or Colledge where Learning is valued among the Students, it is of greater force for Learning, than the ſevere ſtripes of the moſt rigid Maſter. So mean a thing as a Top-knot by the alone ſtrength of this, has ſtood out againſt the powerful Arguments of Reaſon, and ſerious Prayers of tender Conſciences, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50846:51"/> of Relations and Friends, the Satyrs of Wits, the Ridicule of the Bullies, the pointing of the Boys, all theſe joyned together, have not been able to pull down this Enſign from the Tower it ſtood on. The ſtrength of the hold lay in the Cuſtom and Faſhion of the place we live in: How awful might this be, if we conſider how many things of far greater Moment, and worſe Influence, this is a foundation to in each of us, ſince in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. to follow the faſhion of the World, is a certain ſign of a <hi>Child of Diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the Laſt thing in the Verſe, the ſtrength of the Argument, or neceſſary Connexion between Juſtification by Works and Glorying, what is juſt ground for the one, is juſt ground for the other alſo, they have a reciprocal Relation, <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.27, 28. if no matter of Glorying, not juſtifieed by Works in this Verſe; not juſtified by Works, becauſe no Matter of Glorying. The Reaſons of the Connexion are, 1. The Same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Identity of the Matter; the difference between Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Juſtifying lyes only in Circumſtances; the one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Populacy, the other is in a Court of Authority; the one is a Panegyrick, the other a Juridical Tranſaction; the one ſuppoſes an Accuſation or Suſpicion, the other not; they differ as Comfort and Joy, Repentance and Obedience, they are of the ſame Intrinſical Nature: Comfort and Joy are the ſame motion of Blood and Spirits, the ſame Temper of Mind; the Acts of Obedience and Repentance are Works of the ſame Law, only the one ſuppoſes the Courſe of Obedience interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it's a repeated or renew'd Obedience after Tranſgreſſion, as Comfort renew'd Joy after Sorrow. Juſtification is a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Honour and Credit by Authority; after ſome Cloud on it, it is renew'd Praiſe or Glory. Among Men there is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally another difference in degree, Men are prais'd for Heroick Acts, Acts of great advantage to Learning, Religion or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but juſtify'd for obeying Orders, doing no Evil or Injury to them: But this has no place with God, for we are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants at beſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Humility is the Teſt of all true Doctrine, and therefore a proper Teſt for this Doctrine of Juſtification: Whatever Doctrine tends to the debaſing of a Sinner, and humbling of a Creature, is ſound Doctrine. <hi>To walk humbly with our God,</hi> is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50846:52"/> the ſumm of our Religion; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. their <hi>going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> is called the <hi>want of Submiſſion to God.</hi> The humble Publican went home juſtified, while the proud Phariſee, ſtanding upon his Perſonal Differences, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. The Papiſts, thô in Diſpute with Proteſtants, do ſeem to deny a Glorying to their Works, yet Neceſſary Connexion makes the contrary Concluſion appear in their own Writings againſt their Will. <hi>Bell. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>De Juſt.</hi> ſays, Becauſe it is more honourable to have ſomewhat of Merit than of Grace alone, therefore God, that he might the more Honour his Children, has done this for them, that they might prepare Eternal Life to themſelves by their own Merits: and yet more proudly, <hi>Ruard. Tap. in Art. Lev.</hi> God forbid that the Righteous ſhould expect Life Eternal as a poor Man doth Alms, for its much more Glorious for them to poſſeſs Heaven as Victors and Triumphers do a Palm of Glory due to their own Sweats. But the Scripture teaches us, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 115.1. to ſay, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory, for thy Mercy and for thy Truths ſake:</hi> Rom. 3.19. <hi>Every mouth muſt be ſtopt before God;</hi> for we have not one word to ſay in our own defence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God doth never deny Man his due. Humility is the true Sentiment or Value of a Man's own ſelf in his own Mind, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we are only required not to think of our ſelves above what's meet, or <hi>not to think of our ſelves more highly than we ought,</hi> Rom. 12.3. yea, 'tis added poſitively, that we may think of our ſelves <hi>ſoberly, according to the meaſure of Faith God has given us:</hi> And becauſe Scripture is a true Rule to our Judgment, we are bid to think not <hi>above what's written.</hi> If therefore we had any Works to be juſtified by, or any Ground to plead from as of our ſelves, our Glorying ſo far would not be a Sin. God aſcrib'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> Glorying before Men, becauſe his due.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Glorying is a Species of Pride, but Self-juſtifying is a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. We can never be juſtify'd thrô the Exerciſe of what is moſt abominable to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. and 18.12. <hi>God reſiſts the proud;</hi> they are Sins of the ſame kind, and ſuppoſe a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Temper of Mind, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. and a Mind very ignorant of it's own Condition; <hi>Job</hi> 42. he owns he had utter'd what he underſtood not, ſince more acquainted with God his Judgment
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50846:52"/> is alter'd. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, thô he were ſo ſinleſs <hi>as to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by himſelf,</hi> he durſt not adventure a Tryal upon that ſcore, <hi>yet I am not thereby juſtify'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. To be Juſtify'd by Sincerity, would afford us as much Glorying, as <hi>Adam</hi> by Perfection; becauſe his ſtrength propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd: It's as much Glory for a Child to do a little thing, as a Man a greater; that we have receiv'd the Grace thrô a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, doth not abate any Glorying. <hi>Adam</hi>'s was Free Gift, this our Sureties and Brothers Purchaſe; nor that ours ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to Chriſt's, for it's reckon'd the ſole Condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, that gives right to Chriſt's Merits. Chriſt's Merits are no Conditions of that Covenant: Works, Faith and Repentance are not <hi>Lex Negotio addita,</hi> but <hi>Negotium</hi> it ſelf in it.</p>
            <p>This is the ſenſe of them who would bring in Evangelical Works, as giving a right to Remiſſion of Sin, or Glory. It's true, the Angels are juſtifi'd by their Works, yet <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. they aſcribe all Glory to God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: But that is the Glory of thoſe Works they could not perform, the Work of Redemption and ſaving of ſinful Man; but we do not find them denying themſelves to the Glory of not Confederating with the falſe fallen Ones, tho' they deriv'd the Grace by which they ſtood from God. If our Sincerity were the proper Condition or Matter of our Juſtification, Man might Glory of God's yielding to him, and coming to lower Terms. All own the Works of the Innocent deſerves praiſe; but if a Nocent and Guilty Perſon ſhould bring forth Works worthy of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificacion, he ſhould deſerve more praiſe than the Innocent, becauſe Works of an higher value neceſſary to it, nay more praiſe than the Works of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; far eaſier to be Mediator for another than themſelves; eaſier for an Innocent to Merit than a guilty Perſon to Merit. Sinleſneſs was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Qualification in the Mediator; but if one ſinful could Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the more Worth muſt be in the Work: Therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be granted a Working, Meriting, Glorying under Chriſt, it may be equal to <hi>Adam</hi>'s, for if he had ſtood as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, it muſt have been by freely given Grace; but this cannot be allow'd, becauſe a more low Humility is required of us than <hi>Adam,</hi> by Repentance, Sorrow, Grief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore I add</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is no Kind of Works but affords ſome Matter of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50846:53"/> Glory in them: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excuded. By what Law? of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith:</hi> So where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is place for Works, as the Condition of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, there is place for ſome boaſting; but the Scripture every where ſtops Man's mouth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World may become guilty before God:</hi> And it aſcribes all the Glory to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory, for thy Mercy and for thy Truths ſake;</hi> Eph. 1.6. <hi>To the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. All kind of Works affords ſome Plea, and pleading is a Glorying, for it is a ſtanding upon our own defence; and this is another way of addreſſing God than either the Example of the Saints, or the Rules of Holy Writ teach us; Petition and Confeſſion, Deprecation and Lamentation, with Praiſe and Thankſgiving on the Receipt of Mercies, are the only ways we are taught to approach God. The loweſt kind of pleading is one of theſe four: Firſt, By way of Compariſon, as when a Man can ſay, I muſt have either done that or worſe; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have neglected a Parent or a Wife, either to have fled, or ſuffered the Army to be cut off, there was no room for this Excuſe in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin. Secondly, Relation, when we throw the fault upon them that accuſe us; this did but aggravate <hi>Adam</hi>'s Crime, and add to the Sin, when he ſaid, <hi>The Woman whom thou gaveſt me.</hi> Thirdly, When we remove the Evil of the Fact upon ſome other Perſon, as <hi>Eve</hi> did the eating of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Serpent, and <hi>Adam</hi> upon <hi>Eve.</hi> Laſtly, A Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we acknowledge the Fact, but diminiſh it thrô ſome neceſſary Circumſtances, or Ignorance. We do not find any of theſe ways uſual, or acceptable at the Throne of Grace, but rather an aggravating of our own Guilt, like <hi>Poreus</hi> when he was Converted from the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Error, to the Catholick Truth. <q>What I ſhall firſt condemn in my ſelf I know not, wherein to excuſe my ſelf I know not.</q> Petition or Deprecation, ſays the Learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> out of <hi>Cicero,</hi> is no pleading, except for a Perſon whoſe former Actions have highly merited — and therefore it becomes not a Court of Juſtice, as <hi>Cicero</hi> for <hi>Ligarius</hi> before <hi>Caeſar,</hi> 
               <q>O <hi>Caeſar,</hi> I have brought many Pleas, and that before thee when in Court, where thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Authority was concerned, but never as now
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50846:53"/> when privately and before a Parent, then I pleaded, the Crime is a Fiction, the Witneſſes are falſe, he never did it, he never thought it: But now, O Father, he has erred, he has fallen, he will never do the like:</q> But a Juſtifying Defence muſt be made before Authority Juridical.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this with Anſwering ſome Objections briefly, that are brought as Arguments to prove, that ſince no Works are excluded, but what affords occaſion of Glorying, then ſome Works may have room for an Intereſt in our Juſtification. For inſtance, 1. God may freely firſt give Grace to work, give Faith and Repentance, and then juſtifie us for the Exerciſe of them, whereof we cannot Glory, becauſe the Grace is receiv'd, and they are the Fruits of Grace. 2. God gives a Gracious Law, a New Law, the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.27. that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Glorying, and therefore we may be juſtified by the Works thereof. 3. Theſe Works come not in as the Meriting Cauſe of Juſtification, but as the Condition of it. <hi>Resp.</hi> In general this Contrivance of the Method of Juſtification is ſuch a Fruit of Divine Wiſdom, that it is the ſpecial Glory thereof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no wonder that the feeble Beam of our Light, cannot ſhow us the depth of it, or pierce into all the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Connexions of it's parts, or their mutual Relations and Influence, and conſequently no wonder Divines do not agree about ſuch things, and the Diſagreement ought to be born with Meekneſs, Patience, and mutual Endeavour to inſtruct one another. I profeſs my ſelf a Seeker and a Learner in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe myſterious Points, and I am never ſatisfied with a Sermon, except I receive ſome Edification to my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by it: And if Diviſions and bitter Language, unbecoming Chriſtians, Scholars or Men, were not the ſad Fruits of theſe Diſputants, not the Diſputes, they ought to be encourag'd; I bleſs God for the Sparks I have already receiv'd from them, and I hope to receive more; and that my Heart is as much united in Love to both Parties as ever, and I am as much at a Loſs as the poor Children when ask'd whether they Love Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother beſt: But in particular I ſhall begin with the firſt Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. It is inconſiſtent with what I have before prov'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Gift of abſolute and diſtinguiſhing Grace, the Spirit, a New Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that beſide its abſolute and ſanctifying Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50846:54"/> it is of a Relative Nature, both to ſignifie and entitle, as the Ring in Marriage, or other Earneſts and entitling Symbols. <hi>Phil. Melanct.</hi> in his Annotat. on this Epiſtle, [in Compariſon of which, (<hi>Luther</hi> ſays) that <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Origens</hi> Commentaries are but <hi>Merae nugae &amp; Ineptiae</hi>] ſays, <hi>Deus ſolus Juſtificat transfundens in nos Spiritum ſuum,</hi> p. 17. We muſt either reckon him a Papiſt, who was the firſt Proteſtant, (this Book I have is Printed 1522.) or elſe ſay that Gift was the Sentence, or its declarative Sign. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, <q>When a Perſon is Converted, the Angels rejoyce, and therefore have ſome Notification of it; and they who know our Converſion, cannot be ignorant of our Juſtification, which they cannot know without ſome Divine Manifeſtation: A ſecond part of the expreſs'd or declar'd Sentence of our Juſtification (he ſays) is the illuſtration of our Minds with the Holy Spirit, althò often obſcure.</q> I think there is great Reaſon to unite theſe two in one, thus: The Angels who are ſo well acquainted with our Minds, and the Language of Divine Operations, know our Juſtification from the ruling of the Spirit in us, after ſuch a ſpecial manner: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Who is the earneſt of our Inheritance,</hi> and ſo the Earneſt of total and Compleat Pardon. Now if Abſolute Grace bear the Nature of a Title or Sentence, the Exerciſe cannot be the Cauſe, tho' it may be the Condition, that is orderly Connexion: for tho' it procure it's own Confent, it is not receiv'd, except com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with, and yielded to. Our Confeſſion of Faith ſays, We are not juſtifyjd, until the Holy Spirit apply Chriſt to us, and confirms it from <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.6, 7. which Text ſeems to ſhew a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Connexion between them than that of Time; <hi>By the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, that being juſtified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Resp.</hi> 3. Such a Special Gift as the Spirit is, the Grace of Faith and Repentance is, ſuppoſes the Imputation of Chriſt's
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50846:54"/> Righteouſneſs; tho' ſuch Gifts as Men in Common receive, <hi>viz.</hi> A Reprieve from Hell, and outward Benefits, may not, yet ſuch as Spiritual Life cannot be given without it. A Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for Treaſon may have Conveniencies allow'd him, and ſome Favours, but Places of Truſt cannot be beſtow'd on him; there is a neceſſary Connexion among all Spiritual Bleſſings, in due order to be poſſeſs'd, whereof Faith is the firſt, and therefore the Argument is good from the firſt to the laſt, if Faith, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, Eternal Life; <hi>It is of Faith, that it might be of Grace.</hi> Thus <hi>Poieret</hi> argues, It is not Conſiſtent with our Soveraign Lord and Governour to forgive Impenitent Perſons, for that were to let them have all the Glory; for by yielding, he ſhould loſe his own Authority; and it is as inconſiſtent to give the beſt of his Bleſſings to them, to deal equally with Friends and Foes, Rebels and Obedient Subjects; but to give his Spirit, is to give the richeſt Fruit of his Love: How ſhall then Man be ſaved? He Anſwers, By providing a Mediator, and granting to them an Intereſt in his Satisfaction, therefore this Intereſt is firſt in order to be enjoyed: Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are Fruits of his Death, and inſeparably united with the others: The firſt Fountain is Mercy and Favour on the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Account, Pardon of our Sin follows Imputation of his Righteouſneſs; immediately therefore as ſoon as ſuch Gifts are, Pardon is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> 4. That Exerciſe of Faith needs a Pardon, being imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and muſt firſt be accepted, before it can render us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; It is common Doctrine, That the Perſon muſt be juſtifi'd before the Actions, <hi>The Tree muſt be good, then the Fruits:</hi> A Cauſe muſt be before the Effect; ſo theſe two things prevents this Order, the Poſteriority and Pollutedneſs of our Actions: Tho' Grace is pure as from the Spirit, ſinful Infirmity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies every Action of ours; and ſo there muſt be an Intereſt in Chriſt antecedently for the Pardon of theſe Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resp.</hi> 5. This would make the Covenant of Grace a Covenant of Works; for our Ability to obey was from God then, as is mention'd <hi>Argument</hi> 5. before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. That we may be juſtilled by Obedience to the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> without boaſting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.</p>

               <hi>Reſp.</hi> (1.) It is the Common ſence of Interpreters, that the word <hi>Law</hi> here, is put in figuratively, for Faith, or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50846:55"/> of Faith, becauſe it comes in the room of the Law, as Chriſt's Satisfaction is call'd <hi>a Righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe it comes in place of ours: for ſuffering is a bearing of the Threatning of the Law, and not properly Righteouſneſs. (2.) Beſide, the Name of a Law being honourable in the Jews eſteem, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in their Mouths, as the Foundation of all their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Priviledges, the Apoſtle in imitation of them calls Faith a Law. (3.) From the Likeneſs of Faith to a Law, it being a powerful productive principle of Good Works: On the ſame account we read of the <hi>Law of the Mind,</hi> the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> may be Faith is meant by both; ſo we read of the <hi>Law of our Members,</hi> which is <hi>Fleſh,</hi> or our fleſhly Diſpoſition: Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Papiſts add <hi>thy,</hi> becauſe they think Glorying is only excluded from Works entirely our own, the Fruit of our Free-will. The ſenſe of the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> ſeems to be, that the Works of no Law will bring us to Glory, but thro' Faith, without Faith the Work of no Law is acceptable. The Subſtance of the Text lyes in this Syllogiſm. <hi>Major.</hi> Sinful Man muſt be Juſtified in ſuch a way as muſt exclude all Matter of Glorying. The <hi>Minor</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by way of a Rhetorical Dialogiſm, by which, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> ſays, the Apoſtle inſults over his Adverſaries; having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the Truth, he thunders againſt Pride, the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Error: <hi>Where is boaſting then?</hi> The Law of <hi>Faith,</hi> not of <hi>Works</hi> does exclude boaſting. The Concluſion is in the 28th. Verſe, That <hi>therefore a Man is juſtified by Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Deeds of the Law;</hi> the very ſame Argument that is in the Text I have been treating of: And becauſe of the Affinity, or rather Identity with the former, I ſhall the more amply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it: and to begin with the Major Propoſition. I may call it the Fifth Principle of the Apoſtles accurately connexed
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50846:56"/> Diſcourſe; the firſt is, That Salvation, Forgiveneſs of Sin, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, is a poſſible thing, it is vain to preach what is not attainable: Deſpair plucks up the very Roots of Diligence, Hope is the very Spring to Vertue. The ſecond is, that there is no Juſtification without a Righteouſneſs; God cannot be juſt, and juſtifie the unjuſt too, that is an Abomination, next to the Condemning of Innocent. Thirdly, No Man has any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs of his own, whether <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi> Fourthly, That all Righteouſneſs is by <hi>a Law;</hi> on this Subject he ſhews there is a Tripple Law: The Natural Law, and it's <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> from <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.17. to <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.17. he excludes both the Law and it's Righteouſneſs from any Ability of this kind. (2.) The Moſaical and Moral Law, from that <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. to the 21ſt. of the third Chapter; he alſo excludes that Law and it's Righteouſneſs from being able to juſtifie Sinners: From <hi>Verſe</hi> 21. he begins poſitively to aſſert and explain a third Righteouſneſs, which he calls the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith; and a third Law, a Law of Faith: All which is Evangelical, for in the beginning of the Epiſtle he had deſcribed the Goſpel and his own ſeparation to the Office of preaching it, and laid down this Doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.16, 17. That it was <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation to every Believer;</hi> and the Reaſon it is ſo, is, becauſe <hi>therein is the Righteouſneſs of God revealed:</hi> This <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> after having excluded the Law, with it's Works, he moſt accurately explains, from Verſe 21. to the Text, where he begins a Diſcourſe which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the former, and a Propoſition to the latter part of the Context, built upon this fifth Axiom, That there is a Neceſſity of the Juſtification of Sinners being in ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that may utterly ſtop their Mouth from either <hi>Glorying</hi> or <hi>Boaſting:</hi> God has his Glory for his ultimate End in all his Actions, but there is a particular Reaſon, that the Glory be entirely his in this great Action; for a Sinner is Gods Enemy, there is a Controverſie between them; if the Peace or Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation ſhould be ſo made up, as Man ſhould have any thing to brag of, God were ſo far the Yielder, and conquer'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Man were the Victor and Triumpher in this Affair; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Glory we aſcribe to Man, we derogate ſo much from God. This may be clearly illuſtrated, by the Tranſactions of Peace between Armies, Nations, Beſiegers and Beſieged; they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50846:56"/> contend as much for having the Glory of the Peace on their ſide, as for having the Victory of the War on their ſide: And we find the Scripture punctual in aſcribing the Glory to God in all the particular parts and points of this great Contrivance. (1.) <hi>Election,</hi> Eph. 1.4. (2.) <hi>Permiſſion,</hi> the very letting of Man fall in Sin. <hi>Strangius</hi> ſays, Sin is none of Gods Mediums, but the Permiſſion of Sin is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. (3.) The Calling of Man, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. (4.) The ſending of the Son into the World. (5.) The ordaining of ſuch weak Ordinances for means of Converſion and Edification. (6.) The Calling of Men, when they ſtand at greateſt diſadvantage for Converſion; and ſo all the other parts of this whole Project; and likewiſe we find the Scripture in nothing more punctual than in deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Man's Guilt and Impotency, his Wickedneſs and his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every thing that may contribute to humble and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him in the ſight of God. And Satan is in nothing more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent than to propagate this Luſt of Pride: it was his own firſt Sin, and the Foundation of his Kingdom, and he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it as the principal Pillar thereof. Carnal Pride is a very ſtrong Hold in his Kingdom; it is a very difficult thing to be denied to Credit, Honour, and Reputation among Men: But Spiritual Pride is a more ſubtil Sin, and not eaſily diſcernable, far leſs conquerable: And if Satan can maintain this one hold, we are never like to be ſound about this Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whatever may be our Speculative Opinions in Profeſſion, if we retain a Practical Sentiment of a Self-diſtinguiſhing Work, we run a very great Danger as to our Souls: Therefore as ever we would obtain this incomparable Priviledge, we would endeavour to <hi>walk humbly with God,</hi> and to get Self-abaſing Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our Selves.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Minor Propoſition, or ſecond Doctrine, which the Text expreſſes by way of Dialogiſm: <hi>What is not,</hi> and <hi>what is</hi> the way of Juſtification that excludes Glorying. I ſhall begin with the Negative part. <hi>viz. That Glorying is not excluded by the Law of Works:</hi> The Sence of it is, That if a Perſon can be juſtified by Works, he doth not want Matter of Glorying; for God doth not require Humility of a Man beyond his due; if his own Works can anſwer for him before the Tribunal of God, he has in Juſtice, <hi>viz.</hi> Diſtributive, merited his Life, and where
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50846:57"/> there is Matter of Merit, there is Matter of Glory. There are a great many attempts to diminiſh this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> If a Man be juſtified by Works, he has Matter to Glory by the Law of Works: (1.) Some ſay it is only the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> and it's Works. (2.) Others ſay it is only the <hi>Judicial Law,</hi> and External part of the Moral, which made up the Jews Civil Law. (3.) Others ſay, only the Moral Law is excluded ſo far as obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Grace. (4.) Others ſay, it's the Moſaical Law in the Phariſaical ſenſe thereof. (5.) Others ſay, 'Tis the Law as requiring Perfection. (6.) Others as Meriting. But (7.) It has been the moſt Univerſal Sentiment among Proteſtants, that all Law is excluded, and all Inherent Works in ſinful Men as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or being conformed to that Law. It is more eaſie to fix upon this Queſtion, Whether or not the Evangelical Law and it's Works be excluded, yea, or not? For though all theſe ſix Ways differ in what Law is excluded, yet they generally agree, that the Evangelical Law, with it's Evangelical Obedience, are not here excluded, but put in oppoſition to the former, and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this Notion of <hi>the Law of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing Needfull, is, to enquire into the Nature of this Evangelical Law, which is the Influence of the Goſpel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law: The Moral Law and the Goſpel are the two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients whereof our Chriſtian Religion is Conſtituted, and being thus Compounded, have an Influence one upon another; and the Law by reaſon of the New Modes and Relations it receives from this bleſſed Yoak-fellow in the Covenant of Grace, is called a <hi>New Law</hi> and a <hi>New Commandment,</hi> and an <hi>eaſie Yoak</hi> and <hi>light Burden.</hi> The New Conſtitution of the Law that we are under, is one of the bleſſed Fruits of Chriſt's Death, and this makes the Preaching of the Law Goſpel to us; for the Goſpel ſtrictly taken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. to the 17. <hi>v.</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. from the 21. to the 26. <hi>v.</hi> is a Narrative of Chriſt, his Nature, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Offices, States, with the bleſſed Fruits thereof to us, and the Manner of Application to us by the Power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sprit. But in particular, the Moral Law is by the Goſpel a New Law, that is, a Renewed Law after Man's Fall; <hi>Jure,</hi> the Law was quite Obliterated, but he who is <hi>the Light that enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens every one that comes into the World,</hi> has re-wrote ſome Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Parts of this Law in their Conſciences, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. But it has received a newer and later Edition
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50846:57"/> under <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet a Newer under the Goſpel by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and a Newer ſtill, when the Spirit writes a Clear and Regular Copy thereof from the Law, upon the Hearts of Men, which is called <hi>The engrafted Word,</hi> 1 John 2.7, 8. You may find the ſame Law called <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old,</hi> and it's uſual in Scripture to call that that is renewed, <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Goſpel brings the Law under a New Authority: The Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays well, <q>That ever ſince the Fall, the very Law of Nature has been in the hand of Chriſt: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3.</q> 
               <hi>The Earth and all the Inhabitants thereof are diſſolved, I bear up the Pillars of it,</hi> Selah. All things had turned into a meer Chaos, if he had not ſtept in to preſerve an Order upon a New Bottom, and there is no Order without a Law or Rule: <hi>Ver.</hi> 31. of the Context it is ſaid, <hi>Faith,</hi> that is the Goſpel, <hi>doth Eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Chriſt could not be King or Governour of the World without a Law, and his Law muſt reach as far as his Government is extended: He could not Judge the World but by a Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. &amp; 97. <hi>The Earth's</hi> Commanded <hi>to Rejoyce, and the multitude of Iſles to be Glad,</hi> becauſe ſuch a Lord Reigns; and from the 7th. of the <hi>Acts</hi> 31, to 39. we may ſee 'twas Chriſt that Delivered the Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for he is ſaid to be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet to be an Angel; and more fully and particularly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. he Delivers the ſame Law; <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. Goſpel-Ordinances are ſolely founded upon his Authority; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Church-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to be adminiſtred in his Name.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Goſpel gives to the Law a New-Spring, or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Obedience. <hi>Adam</hi> received Ability from God to obey, but the Ability was due, and it is now forfeited and loſt: <hi>We are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works. The End of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is Charity, out of a Pure Heart, and of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Faith unfeigned.</hi> Rom. 8.3. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life.</hi> It is this Living Sprit that enables us to fulfill the Law: I might add to this the Newneſs of Security, it being by Promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my Fear into their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me:</hi> And the Newneſs of the Order, the Promiſes ſtand here firſt, and then the Precepts; God puts his Law in our Hearts, before we Obey.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Goſpel gives to the Law New Ends: This is a Common End with the former, that it directs our Duty, and acquaints us
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50846:58"/> with the Nature of God; but it doth not now ſtand as that which we are to be juſtified or Condemned by: There is a <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> that now comes in Room of that <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law,</hi> ſo as it hath loſt that Old End, it has gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome New Ones. (1.) To teach us the knowledge of Sin. (2.) What Chriſt has done for us: And (3.) What Need we have of him: (4.) What we have Received from him: And (5.) Fits and Prepares us to be Fellow-Companions of his; and though it's Obedience doth not give Right to Heaven, it ſerves for a certain Mark of the Right to Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life.</hi> The Text ſays not that <hi>doing</hi> gives a Right, but that all have a Right who <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Law receives from the Goſpel New Motives; Ends and Motives differ as Future and Paſt: Creation, Proviſion and Providence, were the Motives of our Firſt Duty; but now Chriſts Redeeming us, and the Spirits Callng us, are Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to obey the Law. We ſee Dilivery from the Bondage of <hi>Egypt</hi> was a Motive to the <hi>Iſralites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. There is a New Manner of Acceptance. Acceptance was formerly Bottomed upon the Exact Conformity of our Rightouſneſs to the Law, but Now Faith is the Reaſon of Acceptance: <hi>Without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God: What ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of Faith is Sin:</hi> All is to be done and accepted in the Name of Chriſt: Works before were Accepted for their being a Fulfilling of a Law; now they are for Chriſts Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the Law for us; the Imperfection or Sinfulneſs of the Action is Pardoned on his Accompt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Goſpel Renders a New Meaſure of Law Obedience Acceptable: not that the Law is Altered in its Perfection; for Perfection in Faith is ſtill required, and Perfection in Patience. <hi>Let Patience have its Perfect Work:</hi> but the Work is made up between the Spirit and the Son: the Defects in Meaſure, Manner, or Circumſtances, are Forgiven, if it be the Sprits Work. I may add here, Repentance, becauſe Perpetuity was one of the Meaſures of former Obedience, and Repentance Comprehends the whole Duty of the Law; but it only Implies an Interruption, that our Obedience has been for a conſiderable Time ſtopt; it is to be wiſe after Folly, and to be Obedient after Rebellion. The Chief Circumſtance it differs in from
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50846:58"/> former Obedience, is a leavihg off to do Ill; ſo Repentance muſt be Obendience to the ſame Law was Broken.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Goſpel adds many New Objects to the Duties of the Law: By the Law we were to have no Gods for our God but one; Now we are alſo to have No Mediator but one. <hi>There is but one God, and one Mediator between God and Men;</hi> ſo that Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me,</hi> ſays alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Mediator:</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>There are many called Gods, and called Lords; but to us there is but One God, and One Lord.</hi> We are to love our Brethren by the Law of Nature, but Now we are to ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with them, from that Change that is made in Nature by Sin; <hi>Bear ye one anothers burdens, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt.</hi> The Angels have now new Objects of their Duty ſince the Fall, for they ſerve the Mediator, they protect and defend his Church: We were to truſt in a Righteouſneſs of our Own for Life by the firſt Law, but the Righteouſneſs of another is a New Object the Goſpel brings in.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There are many poſitive Precepts added to the Law by the Goſpel: The Law of Nature is ſo large, as to comprehend all Duty under this Axiom, That we are to do whatſoever God enjoyns, or reveals; but beſide, it has ſubdivided Axioms in particular, to which all Kind of Duties are ſpecifically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible: The Fourth Command doth now as well require the Obſervation of the Firſt day of the Week, as it did formerly of the Seventh; for the Injunction and the Bleſſing are both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> not the <hi>ſeventh;</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves reduce all the Sacred Time to it. The Second Command doth Now comprehend all poſitive Ordinances under the Goſpel, Baptiſm, Lords Supper, Miniſtry, Church Order, and all other external Worſhip; they are as juſtly reducible to that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as Circumciſion, Sacrifices and Legal Waſhings were. Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays acutely, <q>That the Law of Nature is what a reaſonable Nature obſerves to be due from that Relation that is between Men and God, or Men and Men; <hi>Mutatâ Naturâ, mutatur Lex Naturae.</hi>
               </q> To Love our Enemies, to be Charitable to the Poor, to Repent of our Offences, had been Paradoxical Duties to a ſinleſs Man; but now they are plain Duties of the Law of Nature.</p>
            <p n="10">10. From theſe very Circumſtances, the Goſpel brings a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50846:59"/> greater clearneſs and particularneſs to the Duties of the Law, than the Law it ſelf ſince the Fall. The Bleſſed Trinity, that great Myſtery, which is the adequate Object of our Worſhip, is more manifeſted by the Goſpel, than ever the Law could have done; the Example of Chriſt fulfilling all the Law before the Eyes of Men, has not only caſt an Honour, but a luſtre up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as it never had before; the formal Reaſons of Duties were never ſo diſcovered as they are by the Goſpel, beſides thoſe Comments that in the Goſpel he and his Apoſtles have made of it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Goſpel has yet a greater Influence upon the Law, in removing of it's rigorous way of exacting Obedience of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man, it has a Coercive Irritating and Condemning Power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Firſt, A Coercive, becauſe by the Terror of its Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings it Commands what Man abhorrs, and when the poor Sinner obeys, he doth it as a Brute, for fear of blows, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient,</hi> &amp;c. The Quietiſts ſay, that properly the Name of a Law ariſes from the Contention and War between Man's Inclinations and Duties; but when the Law is Writ in our Minds, and becomes our Delight, it is a Goſpel, not a Law: however, when the Goſpel brings in Light and Strength, it becomes a very eaſie Yoke. The Law of the Spirit encreaſes it's ſtrength, and the Law of the Members decay and dye: We obey by a kind of perſwaſion, God's Efficacy is ſo gentle upon the Soul, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>This perſwaſion cometh not of him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you.</hi> Secondly, It has an irritative, or Pollutive Power: It's an Old Proverb, <hi>Nitimur in vetitum:</hi> Our deſire encreaſes by being forbid; Sins taking occaſion by the <hi>Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence; for without the Law ſin was dead.</hi> Some think that Swearing, Prophaning the Name of God, and Adultery, ariſes chiefly from this Natural Contradiction in us to the Nature of God; if Perſons thought them no Sins, they would never ſo much delight in them. Thirdly, It has a Condemning Power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. it's called <hi>a killing Letter.</hi> The Goſpel is a City of Refuge; <hi>There is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who has ſatisfied the Law for all intereſted in him: This is a Newneſs, altering the Law from what it was to Man ſinful, not ſinleſs.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Law, which of it ſelf is the Spring of Terrors, <hi>for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50846:59"/> the ſtrength of Sin is the Law,</hi> becomes a Handmaid to Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in and thrô the Goſpel; partly by its diſcovering to us, that Chriſt has fulfilled the Law for us; this is the Marrow of the Goſpel, and by it the Law of Works is turned into a Law of Faith: Partly as it is an inſtrument to intereſt us into the Goſpel; partly as the Law fulfill'd or ſatisfy'd by Chriſt, is ſeen by Faith. By the Law we have the Knowledge of Sin, <hi>James</hi> 1.24. That's a Glaſs to ſee our ſelves in, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. The Goſpel is a Glaſs to ſee Chriſt in; the more vile and horrible the Looks of the one appears, the more aimiable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the other. The Law is a Judge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. to kill the Man by Sentence, and to revive Sin. Man by Nature and Satan's deceitfulneſs is very ſecure, and a great Self-flatterer; but if the Spirit of the Goſpel enliven the Law, it makes a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all the Threatnings on himſelf, and bring him under a Spirit of Bondage: He cries, I am accurſed, I poſſeſs the Sins of my Youth; my Sin is ever before me, I am undone. So the Goſpel Spirit takes the killing Letter of the Law, and rouſes him out of his Lethargy, it makes a Man weary and heavy laden; it makes People a People prepared for the Lord, for then he begins to ſee what he thought Righteouſneſs, Guilt, and what he thought Gain, Loſs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Goſpel Spirit makes a Bridle of the Law to reſtrain Sin. The Wicked cry, <hi>Let us caſt off theſe Cords from our Neck;</hi> but when the Spirit comes, <hi>a little Child may lead them.</hi> By this Law reſtraining Grace Works; Men are perſwaded to forbear Evil by the Lords Terrors; what would become of either the Goſpel or the Church, if it were not for this Uſe of the Law? Farther, the Law is a <hi>Rule</hi> for directing Evangelized perſons how to live, and it is a <hi>Pattern</hi> from which the Spirit tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a Copy into the Heart of Man: It is a Mean of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</hi> The Goſpel is much honoured when the Saints walk orderly, according to this Rule.</p>
            <p>The Second Enquiry is, about their Opinion whom the Apoſtle here oppoſes, <hi>viz.</hi> What a Chriſtianiz'd <hi>Phariſee</hi> is? For <hi>Act.</hi> 15.5. ſuch they were. I do not ſay they were the <hi>only,</hi> but the <hi>principal</hi> party he oppoſes; how far their Faith and Profeſſion reach'd, and wherein that Error did conſiſt, is next to be conſidered. We find they were of two Kinds:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50846:60"/> Some that did oppoſe the Moſaical Law to the Goſpel, as the Unbelieving Phariſees: Or the Natural Law, as the Pagan Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. The one did overvalue Ceremony, the other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. We find the Apoſtle often diſputing againſt both; againſt the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5. againſt the latter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.19. The former Party did compoſe the Law with the Goſpel: Acts 15.5. <hi>Certain of the Phariſees who believed ſaid, it was needfull to Circumciſe 'em:</hi> Gal. 2.21. <hi>If righteouſneſs be by the Law, Christ dyed in vain;</hi> this Argument would have been of little ſtrength againſt the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who crucifi'd him, and thought he dy'd a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, but of great Influence againſt them who mixed <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, Law and Goſpel, and expected Salvation from their mutual Concurſe. The latter denyed the reality of <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Righteouſneſs, but theſe did deny the Fulneſs of it; they would eak, or add to it; and except it were the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> we find by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, that there was not any Church, but what was moleſted and partly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by this Error: In the Epiſtles to <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Apoſtle calls them <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitful Workers, transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.13. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galat.</hi> he calls it <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> by which they were <hi>Bewitched.</hi> We find the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is Forewarned of ſuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. And in the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> they are Charged of <hi>Falling from their Firſt Love;</hi> yet it is Doubtful whether that came by this Error, or not; For Chriſt Appoves of her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, ſaying, She had <hi>tried them which ſaid they were Apoſtles, and found them liars;</hi> ſhe was moleſted with them, not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. From the Third of <hi>Philippians,</hi> we find that Church was corrupted by 'em; for he calls ſuch Teachers <hi>Dogs, evil Workers, the Conciſion;</hi> and from his own Experience tells 'em he was once ſuch an one that <hi>truſted in the Fleſh,</hi> but now <hi>ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt</hi> and his Righteouſneſs. It is againſt both theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that the Apoſtle here diſputes, but principally againſt theſe latter ſort, as we may ſee by the ſtate of the Queſtion, <hi>Ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Juſtified by Faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi> His Diſputes with the former were of another Kind, <hi>viz.</hi> To convince the Gentiles that Chriſt was <hi>the</hi> and <hi>the only</hi> Mediator, againſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> that Jeſus was the Promiſed <hi>Meſſias:</hi> But here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, If we be juſtified by Faith mixt with the Deeds of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50846:60"/> Law, or without it? And therefore we may conclude, That whatever Truth the unconverted Phariſees held, theſe Converts much more held; and that they did not plead theſe Works of the Law intentionally to exclude Chriſt or his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whom they had embraced.</p>
            <p>Partly from the Scripture, and partly from their own Writings, I find this Account of their Doctrine of the Law. (1.) They were very zealous and laborious in all External Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; they kept the Sabbath to a height of Superſtition; and their Prayers were very long, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.14. (2.) In Juſtice between Man and Man, they were ſo exact, as to <hi>tythe Mint, Anniſe and Cummin.</hi> (3.) And tho Chriſt in every thing blames them for Hypocriſie, yet he owns their Charity, and Alms; but their Hypocriſie was more in Practice than Profeſſion: For (4.) In <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37. they owned <hi>Love to God</hi> and <hi>their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> with all their <hi>Heart, Soul</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> to be the <hi>first and great</hi> Commandment: Which includes a (5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) That Sincerity was in great value with them, as <hi>Sephar Ikkarim,</hi>

               <hi>M. Smith</hi> in his Select Diſcourſes obſerves theſe Defects in their Righteouſneſs, and their Notion of it. (1.) That the Law was meerly a Dead Letter without 'em. (2.) Their Free-will was a Self-ſufficiency within 'em to be a Foundation of Merit. (3.) They might pick out par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50846:62"/> Precepts for their Obſervation, with Neglect of the others. For tho' they have an Axiom, that it is not Lawfull to Skip over Precepts, yet they expounded it thus: A Man is not to leave the Obſervation of one Precept, to go and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve another; yet they have another Canon, <hi>Mizbatorah Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Hajim,</hi> He <hi>that Multiplies the Law, multiplies Life:</hi> Theſe things ſeem to Derogate from the Jewiſh Notion of their Works, rendring it Partial, External, Conſtrained, and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; but theſe following Conſiderations may help to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the former Poſition with the Objections.

They reckoned Sincerity the Meaſure of the Law, or acceptable without Perfection; therefore Chriſt tells the Young Man, <hi>If thou wilt be Perfect,</hi> one Perfectly Righteous: They made a great Difference between Perfection and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; theſe they called <hi>Beninim, Middle-way Men,</hi> that had Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and ſhould go to Eternal Life, either by the Preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their good Works, or Repentance of their Evil: hence <hi>Obadias de Bartanora</hi> ſays, <q>Whoſoever ſhall Perform any one of the 613 Precepts of the Law, without any worldly reſpect, for Love of the Precept, behold this man ſhall Merit thereby Everlaſting Life. And <hi>R. Minach Kekannat,</hi> "Know that the Life of Man in the Precepts is according to his Intention; He who obeys the Commands otherwiſe than for themſelves, ſhall have no Reward but in this Life.</q> So they did not lay the weight of Imperfect Obedience on particular <hi>partial Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but on Sincerity: More Proof of it may be ſeen before on the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Particular, and in <hi>Maimonides</hi> his Explication of the Objection: For, 1.

The Apoſtle ſays not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Receiv'd ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> 2 Cor. 11.4. <hi>If ye receive another Spirit, or hear another Goſpel:</hi> So whatever conſtraint the Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> obey'd from, the Believing obey'd from the Spirit; nay even the Unbelievers own'd Divine Aſſiſtance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12. <hi>I thank thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Aug.</hi> He proudly ſaid <q>He was Righteous, tho' he own'd God the giver of it: Hear this O ye that are worſe than <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who ſay God made you <hi>Men,</hi> but you your ſelves <hi>Righteous. Greg.</hi>
               </q> He rightly thank'd God for the good he had from him. <q>
                  <hi>Stella,</hi> there is a Triple Pride, The firſt denies Gods Gift, The ſecond owns him, but thorough Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; The third, as this <hi>Phariſee,</hi> glories in it.</q> He diſputes
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50846:63"/> againſt the abuſe of the Law, perform'd and obey'd by that Spirit they had receiv'd: <hi>The Law is good, if a Man uſe it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</hi> So there is a great difference both between the Perſons and the State of the Queſtion, from that in <hi>Math.</hi> 5. they were meer <hi>Phariſees,</hi> here <hi>Chriſtians</hi> too. 2. The Queſtion was about the Perfection and Extent of the Law; here it is about its <hi>uſe</hi> and the <hi>Merit</hi> or Worth of its Obedience, ſuppoſing the other Error rectifi'd, which was more Practical than Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: for according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.23. that Sacrifice will not be acceptable, when we are at Enmity with our Brothers: on <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.5. They ſay, <hi>Sacrifice</hi> will not expiate without <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Repentance;</hi> and according to <hi>ver.</hi> 28. the <hi>Talm.</hi> ſays, <hi>He that looks on a Woman</hi> with Intention, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as he that <hi>had gone in unto her;</hi> and according to 29. One had better have their <hi>Belly cleav'd</hi> than go to Hell whole: And according to 34. <hi>Maim.</hi> It is a great good, that a Man <hi>ſwear not at all:</hi> And according to 39. If one call thee Aſs, ſuffer him to put a Saddle on thee too; and according to 44. <hi>Maim.</hi> ſays, <hi>David</hi> was excellently inſtructed with Virtue, when he ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. <hi>I have deliver'd him that without Cauſe is mine Enemy:</hi> For the Law ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Avenge,</hi> Lev. 29.18. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.1. <hi>R.

He that has Bread in his Basket, and ſays, What ſhall I eat for to Morrow, is a Man of little Faith. <hi>Joſ. de Voiſin.</hi> has more of this kind; but it is certain, the Law was corrupted by their Traditions; but this Error here was about its uſe. 4. As to <hi>Free-will,</hi> I do not find that they ſay ſo much as the <hi>Armin.</hi> for <hi>Maim.</hi> ſays, that God can do with the Will of Man what he pleaſes; but he rather chooſes the long and tedious way of Means, than work ſuch a Miracle; as he rather led the People thorough the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to <hi>Canaan,</hi> than the ſhorteſt way by the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> There are three things more, that are conſiderable to help us to the Jewiſh Sentiments in this concern. (1.) Their owning Univerſal and <hi>Original Guilt.</hi> (2.) Their denying their own works to be of <hi>ſufficient Merit,</hi> without reſpect to Divine Mercy, and the Office of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> when he comes: And (3.) Their great <hi>Encomiums</hi> of it. As to the firſt, Thus the <hi>Talmud</hi> from <hi>Beracot:</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd, the whole World ſinn'd, for he was its Perfection; therefore the World loſt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50846:63"/> its Perfection: This can be ſaid of none of his Poſterity; as to the firſt and laſt, <hi>Raym.</hi> 175. <hi>Rab. Joſc. Gabl.</hi> ſays, <hi>Adam</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd one Negative Precept, and behold how many Deaths on all Generations, certainly the Merits of the King <hi>Meſſias</hi> doth over-ballance; much more ſhall he juſtifie all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſince the <hi>Iniquity of all met upon him.</hi> As to the ſecond, the Author of <hi>Nove Schalam,</hi> ſays, on <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will have Mercy on whom I will,</hi> Worthy or Unworthy; and <hi>Ikkarim,</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Not for our Righteouſneſs, but for thy great Mercies:</hi> The Mercies of the Bleſſed God are poured out on all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, not for their Merits, but of Pure Grace; for <hi>who hath given to him, that it may be repaid?</hi> But a ſubordinate Merit they own'd generally for Temporal Things. The <hi>Talmud</hi> has a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was extended the ſpace of three Leagues; which the Author of <hi>Caphtor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phera</hi> explains thus: He ſaw the <hi>Power of this Nation,</hi> (viz. <hi>Baalim) (Numb.</hi> 23.9.) Conſiſting in theſe three things, their <hi>Strength,</hi> their <hi>Multitude,</hi> and their <hi>Merit,</hi> with the Merit of their Fathers, <hi>from the Top of the Rocks,</hi> that is, the Merit of the Patriarchs. <hi>Who can count the Duſt of Jacobs?</hi> That is, their Multitude, and their Power in it; <hi>Let me dye the Death of the Righteous;</hi> there is their own Merit, which he would have ſhared of: Another of its ſayings, <hi>He pluckt up the Mountain,</hi> which contained three Leagues; it's thus explained: As the Thought of <hi>Og,</hi> who ſaid, Since this Nation has not Power with its Multitude to poſſeſs three Leagues, but by the Merit of their Fathers; and now I have got the Merit of <hi>Abraham</hi> from them, therefore I may drive 'em from this Mount, and uſe it againſt 'em. By <hi>Mountain</hi> is meant the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> Iſa. 55.1. <hi>Look unto the Rock whence ye are hewn, look unto Abraham your Father.</hi> A third ſaying, But God brought the Ants who pierced through the Mountain, that is, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whoſe Strength is in their Tongue, Locuſts-like, for by their Prayers, the Merit of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood by 'em, and did not help <hi>Og.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er needed the Merit of all the Patriarchs, and the Merit of the Tribes, and his own Merit. But a ſubordinate Merit they allow in Eternals: In <hi>Raym.</hi> 469. <hi>Bereſhit Rabba</hi> is cited thus: <hi>Jacob</hi> was very afraid, becauſe no Man can be ſecure till Death; and thô <hi>David</hi> knew there was a Reward for the Juſt, and that he was Holy, yet his Sin might prevent his Merit; and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50846:64"/> that all the Promiſes are Conditional, tho' the Condition be not expreſs'd; there was a perpetual Prieſthood promis'd to <hi>Phinehas,</hi> but that was meant if they did not backſlide. So on <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.12. There is an abſolute Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſia,</hi> but at the cloſe of the Chapter, its added, <hi>This ſhall come to paſs, if ye will Diligently obey the Voice of your God:</hi> And thus they explain, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.17. A Promiſe of a <hi>Perpetual Throne to Davids Seed,</hi> and an <hi>Altar</hi> to <hi>Aarons;</hi> the Condition was not fulfill'd, and that Repentance is the greateſt Condition: God will get the Angels to abſolve him from his Oath, if People repent, and yet they cannot repent of themſelves; For on <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. they Paraphraſe thus: <q>There is none of the Callers on thee, that is able to raiſe himſelf up againſt the Figment of his own Heart: (that is, Original Sin,) <hi>That he may take hold of thee,</hi> that thou ſhould'ſt not ſend him to Hell; (here Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit diminiſh'd): They believe all goes to Hell, <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the Prophets, tho' they think ſome of them like a Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Fire; no Merit can deliver from thence but the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </q> Says <hi>R. Jamai,</hi> If I ſhould ſuffer to be cruſh'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Door and its Threſhold, it would not prevail to free me from Death. <hi>R. Juda R.</hi> If my Tongue ſhould be bruis'd by the Hinge of a Door, I could not eſcape Hell. They aſcribe that only to the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> they ſay the Lord told <hi>Adam</hi> when he made him, he muſt be very careful of Sinning, for the World, the Creation would be ruin'd by it; and none could repair it; the Juſt one, <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> muſt ſuffer by it; they fain two ſtrange Conferences, one between God and Satan, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſeeing a Glorious Light under the Throne of God, ask'd whoſe it was? <hi>R.</hi> The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and his Generation. <hi>Satan.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, and I will deſtroy it? <hi>R. God.</hi> Againſt him thou can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail. <hi>Sat.</hi> Let me, I can. <hi>R.</hi> That Attempt will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee out of the World, when none of them ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd. The ſecond Conference did on the back of this, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Meſſias. God</hi> thus: O <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> my Juſt One, theſe who are now in Secret and hid with thee by their Sins, ſhall bring thee into a grievous Age, for thy Eyes ſhall ſee no Light, thy Ears ſhall hear great Reproach, thy Tongue ſhall cleave to the Roof of thy Mouth, and thy Skin to thy Bones, and thou ſhalt be conſumed and waſted through Grief and Sorrow: Wilt thou undertake theſe things?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50846:64"/> if thou doſt it, it is well; if not, I will drive them from my Preſence. The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> anſwered him, Lord of the World, for this I am Glad, and I undertake all theſe Tribulations, on this Condition, that in my day thou ſhalt raiſe the Dead, even all who have died from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> until now; and all thoſe that ſhall be Created, and ſhall ſave them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Concluſion I draw from this large Narrative is, That no part of Evangelical Obedience is here wanting, Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the influence of the Spirit, Jeſus a Lawgiver, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Meriter, Sincerity an acceptable Meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them not all of a Mind, yet Charity will ever make us conclude, the Believers to be of the beſt Mind among them. And the Error here oppos'd in this Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Apoſtle, is the ſame that now in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Proteſtants, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>This was that wherein the Myſtery of Iniquity did already Work;</hi> the Doctrine of Merit was already begun, and no other Error can be found to have ſuch a fair appearance; when the Apoſtle wrote to the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the Church at <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> was free of the Error, and ſhe of all the Churches only was; and may be therefore the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of it was reveal'd to them. Mr. <hi>Squire</hi> of <hi>Shore-ditch</hi> ſays on this Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 
               <q>That the placing of Faith between Mercy and Merits, is like the Infant between the two Mothers; if divided it muſt be deſtroyed: Its like the Pale Horſe, Death ſits on it, and Hell follows; it is a damnable Aſſertion without peradventure, and a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> after his long Diſpute for Merits, concludes, that it is moſt ſafe to truſt in Mercy alone.</q> And what way <hi>Rome</hi> had her firſt beginning by, that way ſhe is moſt likely to attempt her Reſtauration; and by oppoſing Merit, our firſt Reformation began, which has this for its Glory, its a Reſtauration of Chriſtianity to its Primitive Purity; and while we preſerve this Doctrine, ſhe will never corrupt or ſtain our Souls, however ſhe may prevail to oppreſs our Bodies. But it is to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſo many bearing the Name of Proteſtants, are ſo deeply tinctur'd with this Doctrine of <hi>Opera Tincta,</hi> Works Meriting becauſe tinctur'd with Chriſts Merits.</p>
            <p>The Third Enquiry, ſhall be a more cloſe Examination of the Extenſiveneſs and Comprehenſiveneſs of <hi>this Law of W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rks,</hi> that is excluded from being the Rule or Law of our Juſtification:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50846:65"/> Becauſe <hi>boaſting would not be excluded from us by it,</hi> if juſtified by it; and on the moſt ſincere Scrutiny I can make, I find all Laws, and all Works, as perform'd by us, are excluded; the Arguments for Proof of it I ſhall reduce to theſe five Heads. 1. The Nature of a Law in general is excluded. 2. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law is. 3. The Moral Law is. 4. The Moſaical Law is: And 5. The Evangelical, and our Evangelical Obedience to it, is excluded.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Nature of a Law in General is; for every Law is a Law of Works, and a <hi>Law of Works</hi> is excluded: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>Law,</hi> ſignifies either in general <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> Joh. 10.34. <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid ye are Gods?</hi> That is no Precept: See <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. Or it is taken properly, and then it ſignifies a <hi>Doctrine of Works;</hi> hence <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> are reciprocal: <hi>without Law,</hi> Rom. 3.21. is the ſame with 4.6. <hi>without Works.</hi> We are juſtified, not only without the <hi>Law of Works,</hi> but by a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Law:</hi> Gal. 3.21. <hi>If there had been a Law given, which could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law: Works</hi> is no Diſtinctive Addition, as Dr. <hi>Tuck</hi> of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>btidge</hi> ſays, but Explicative, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>The doers of the Law ſhall be juſtifi'd;</hi> to do the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> are the ſame in the Apoſtles ſtyle, they are of ſo nigh kindred; he adds it, to tell us what he means by <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law, viz.</hi> Works Commanded by, and Conform to the Law; the whole Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent parts of the Deſcription of a Law manifeſts this, firſt its generical Nature; its a juſt Act of a Superiors Will. We call <hi>Statutes</hi> or Laws <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> its their Will what the Subject ſhould do: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.8. <hi>He commanded and it ſtood faſt.</hi> Pſal. 143. <hi>Teach me to do thy Will;</hi> and in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Author of a Law is the moſt Supream Power, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minative Power, as the Maſter over the Servant, the Father, Husband, Tutor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Juridical Power is not: Judges are but Adminiſtrators, Applyers of the Law to particular Caſes and Perſons; they are <hi>Juſſa Populi rogante Magiſtratu,</hi> the Peoples Commands ratified by the Supream Magiſtrate. It's very dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive Engliſh of <hi>Juſſa,</hi> when it's called <hi>Votes,</hi> that is only Wiſhes; the old <hi>Saxon</hi> word is <hi>Lowe,</hi> Conſent, becauſe a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50846:65"/> between Prince and People is the Spring of Laws. But why all this Authority? The Command needs it, it's to Work; hard Work is required, and we need Awe to put us on; hence <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. &amp; 20. God ſets an Emblem of his Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity before his Law.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Effects are, (1.) Obligation. (2.) Command and Prohibition. (3.) Puniſhment, or Impunity by permiſſion; but all terminate in Works: And tho' the Mediatorial Law, which was the moſt ſevere Penal Law that ever was, Sufferings being the great Duty, yet the Fruit of it is called <hi>Work,</hi> and <hi>Doing: I come to do thy Will, and to work the Work of his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The Subjects of the Law, are by way of Eminency call'd <hi>Subjects,</hi> Rom. 3.19. <hi>They that are under the Law,</hi> are call'd ſo from its Energy and working Efficacy in them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' only a rational Creature <hi>is a doer of a Law,</hi> mov'd reaſonably by Fear or Hope, yet the Efficacy occaſions Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors in mute Creatures, <hi>Job</hi> 38. <hi>Haſt thou commanded the Morning ſince thy Day?</hi> and our Inclinations to Wickedneſs are call'd the <hi>Law of the Members;</hi> and Rules of Art are call'd <hi>Laws; Cuſtom,</hi> which is a Habit of working, is call'd <hi>a Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The Matter or Object is <hi>Work,</hi> ſomething to be done: <hi>Th. A.</hi> A Law is a Rule directing our Acts, what is to be done, and what not: And again, It's Divine Wiſdom as directive of all our Acts and Motions. <hi>Biel.</hi> It's a ſign of Right Reaſon, dictating what we are obliged to do, and what not.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) The Properties are, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Holy, Juſt and Good:</hi> (1.) Holy, from the Matter; it diſtinguiſhes between Holy Actions and the Vile ones. (2.) Juſt, from the Manner, not to give Laws where not Subjects, or where they neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect nor can Puniſh: The Law-giver muſt be able to <hi>Save or Deſtroy</hi> what he gives Laws to, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. therefore it's ridiculous for Man to give Laws to a Spirit, or Conſcience in Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; and where he has Power he muſt diſtribute Burdens and Works by Proportion, according to Ability; to bring one part of a Nation under Penal Laws, and another under Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, is not an equal diſtribution, except when Offenders or highly meriting; <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. It was a great ſin in the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> to <hi>bind Burdens on others</hi> they touch'd not themſelves. (3.) Good: <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema Lex: Plato</hi> ſays a Law is a Manner of Governing by fit Means, to the beſt End. No Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50846:66"/> that is, <hi>Privae Leges,</hi> ought to be granted without this Proſpect: <hi>Knowledge of Sin, and Wrath,</hi> are the Conſequents of Divine Law; but neither End nor Fruit of them, but of the Tranſgreſſors. (4.) Publickly Proclaim'd. (5.) Firmly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Sanction; Laws are made that the Innocent may be ſafe among the Wicked, that the Wicked's Boldneſs may be bridled; the Law is not for a righteous Man.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) There is no kind of Law but what requires <hi>Works</hi> as its Object; the Negative forbids Works; the irritating make void Works; according to the kind of Works they are diſtinguiſh'd: Natural, of Nations; Civil, Canonical, Priviledges, Poenal, Cuſtoms, Counſels, Moral, Judicial, Ceremonial, Evangelical, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> is not meant the Law requiring Faith, for then it would be a Law of Works; for <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. <hi>To believe is to work the work of God:</hi> Gal. 5.6. <hi>Faith works by Love;</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> even before Converſion, as is before prov'd, own'd Faith as a moſt acceptable Work to God; ſo there would neither be fit diſtinguiſhing Terms of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Propoſitions, nor any Refutation ot the Apoſtle's Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries by this Senſe of it: it muſt therefore either be taken <hi>largely,</hi> for the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> that is, the Goſpel, the Object of our Faith, according to the Cloud of Proteſtant Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators; or which is Materially the ſame, the <hi>Law,</hi> that is the Object of our Faith, and as ſuch he had been before deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Righteouſneſs we are Sav'd by, and Juſtifi'd by, to be a Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. &amp; 3.22. <hi>Reveal'd to Faith,</hi> to be believ'd in; now this Righteouſneſs muſt have a Law, which is the Mediatorial Law, as the other is the Mediator's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; He was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> to <hi>redeem</hi> us from under it: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. He came to <hi>fulfill the Law;</hi> we are Juſtified by his Obedience to the Law for us. So by the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> is not by the Law as Directing and Commanding our Works, but by the Law as believ'd to be fulfill'd by Chriſt in our room: There can be no Pretence or ſhew of Reaſon for the other Opinion, but on this bottom, that by <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are meant different kind of Works: But then why ſhould the general term Comprehending all kind of Works be us'd for one Species? Would that be a good Diviſion, to ſay God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Earth not by an Animal, but by a Man? or not by a Spirit but by an Angel? and there is no ground in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50846:66"/> to take the word thus by <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> as ſhall next be prov'd: For there is no Divine Law under which we are, but what we may find excluded by the Apoſtles Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Natural Law</hi> and its Works are excluded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9. <hi>We have before proved both Jew and Gentile, that they are all under ſin,</hi> V. 19. <hi>All the World is guilty before God;</hi> not from inſufficiency of the Law; for <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. <hi>If the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion keep the Righteouſneſs of the Law, ſhall not his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion be counted for Circumciſion?</hi> for the Law of Nature now is the ſame with that in Innocence, only there is a Change in the Matter. Poſitive Laws do not bind <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> and the Negative Laws are all the ſame ſtill; the Law ſays one thing to a married Perſon, and another to an unmarried: So tho' the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand other things to fallen Man than to innocent Man, it is not another Natural Law: All the Natural Law, <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays, was broken in Eating the Forbidden Fruit; there was Theft, yea Sacriledge, in ſtealing God's <hi>Proprium;</hi> there was Murder of himſelf and his Poſterity; there was Coveting, there was want of Love to God, and Obedience too; yea Idolatry, to an Incarniz'd Devil, having more eſteeming and adoring Thoughts of the Devil than God: So the Matter of the Law is the ſame, and the Meaſure of it too, <hi>viz.</hi> what Reaſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, or may obſerve to be its Duty from Divine Providence; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>The goodneſs and forbearance of God leads to Repentance:</hi> The Author, God; the Principle, Love to God; the End, God's glory and our good, is ſtill the ſame, its Sanction is <hi>Periſhing</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> Rom. 2.12. <hi>They that ſin without Law, periſh without Law;</hi> and if they obſerve it, it ſhall be <hi>Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to them; but all are Sinners, all have broken it, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſe them, they <hi>detain the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> they did what they knew deſerv'd Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Natural Law being excluded, all Law is excluded; for they are all reduceable to it, and conſequently it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of them. Mr. <hi>Baxt.</hi> Method. <hi>p.</hi> 392. <hi>In illo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men omnes eaedem fuere virtualiter aut eminenter:</hi> It is the Mother and Root of them all, but the further the Branches are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Root, the leſſer they are, and the more invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſtand at a greater diſtance from it. 1. Theſe are its Primitive Axioms: That good is to be choſen, and evil to be refuſed, and the greater the good is for Weight or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50846:67"/> with the greater Deſire and Endeavour to be purſued: That we are to do that which is becoming us, and to do as we would be done by in the like Circumſtances. The ſecond Order is more determined, to wit, God is to be worſhipped by true, loving, truſting, adoring and Obediential Thoughts; that the Innocent is not to be Hurt, the Honeſt Man is to be Befriended, the Superior to be Reverenced, the Inferior to be Condeſcended to, and the Indigent to be Supplied, and many other Laws about Patience, Fortitude, Sobriety and Temperance. The third Order is more particular, Vices and Vertues are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, by which Theft, Adultery, Murder, and the like, are forbid. The fourth Order is leſs apparent and evident, to wit, about Revenge, Fornication, Uſury and Self-Murderers, in ſome Caſes, which gives occaſion to Civil and in ſome ſence Canonical Laws alſo. Theſe are two ways reduced to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law: Firſt, becauſe both Civil and Religious Society, and conſequently Government, is conſtituted by this Natural Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be are ordained of God:</hi> Their Authority is both eſtabliſhed and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by his, and therefore their Laws ought to be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to his, which is the ſecond Connexion: <hi>For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the Evil.</hi> Hence a Penal Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to Sin, or to ſuffer, is a moſt unjuſt thing; for it is a Terror to good, yet a Conformity to the Laws of God is pretended to by all Law-givers, even under Paganiſm: The Moral Law is more properly this Law it ſelf, than reductive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to it; for where Moral and Natural is oppoſed, it is in Sciences not in Laws; for what's Moral as to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to wit, Praiſe-worthy, or Blame-worthy, Vice or Vertue, in a Mans Converſation towards God or Man, is natural as to the Principle; for what are Principles of Action in a Man, by common Gift of Knowledge, or Honeſt Inclinations, are natural Principles: Before the Law given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> we may find footſteps of all the Ten Commandments, for <hi>Abel</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in God, which is the Duty of the firſt; and Sacrificed, which is the Duty of the ſecond; and in the third Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when but very few Families on the Earth; and not above three, to wit, <hi>Adam, Seth</hi> and <hi>Enos</hi>'s, that were Worſhippers, except we Charitably Hope ſome were Proſelites of the <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiſh</hi> Race, publick worſhip was eſtabliſhed, <hi>for then Men began
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50846:67"/> to call upon the Name of the Lord:</hi> This was Obedience both to the ſecond and third Commandment, which did ſuppoſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the fourth, to wit, a ſanctifying ſome publickly known Time for Worſhip, whoſe Determination God by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command had fixed, though from a natural Reaſon, to wit, the Seventh-day, in which God had reſted from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt of Works he had yet done in the World: The fifth and the ſeventh Command is manifeſt in the Practice of Marriage, for therein was the Period of Subjection to Parents terminated, in leaving Father and Mother, and an <hi>Aera</hi> of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Wife begun, expreſs't in cleaving to her; and it is probable that laſt and crowning Duty of Childrens Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their Parents, is taxed as broken by theſe <hi>Sons of God,</hi> who took unto themſelves Wives, according to their own Choice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.7. The ſixth and ninth Command were both broke by <hi>Cain,</hi> who murdered his Brother, and then not only denied it, but denied the Knowledge of ſuch a Fact, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8, 9. The eighth and tenth Command are thought by ſome, eſpecially the Quietiſts, to have been neither Commands, nor broken, becauſe there could be no Coveting of enlarging Property, but rather of Men, to ſhare of the common good; and Sin gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to particular Commands, though of ſuch a General Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But we find <hi>Adam</hi> guilty of both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in coveting of a Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and robbing God of his Property; when but one Tree was reſerved in all the World, for an acknowledgment of Gods having the Primitive Right: And we find <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Luſts of the Heart was the cauſe of the Deluge; and all Luſt is coveting. The Ordinance of Circumciſion was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be a Monument and Conviction of the Luſts of the Heart, and the Neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y of Mortification; the <hi>Sweat of the Brow,</hi> and toil of <hi>labour,</hi> were appointed as the means of our Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and the <hi>Nimrodical Hunting</hi> was a robbing men of what God had bleſſed their labour in. So we find the Moral Law in this Law of Nature.</p>
            <p>The next Enquiry, is about the Evangelical Law, whether any Prints of that is to be found under it, yea or not; and taking the natural Law moſt properly, and as here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle explains it in his Diſcourſe, for a Sign of Divine Will about our Duty as revealed in Nature, or by Creation and Providence, we may find footſteps of it here. (1.) For the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50846:68"/> Duties of it, here are both Faith and Repentance rendred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludable from Divine Forbearance and Goodneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance; but after thy hardneſs and impenitent Heart,</hi> &amp;c. (2.) As there are Evangelical Duties, ſo Evangelical Influence; <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Who hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs;</hi> here was a Truth preſerved alive againſt their Wills, and as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. the Spirit of the Lord was ſaid to <hi>ſtrive with men;</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. Thoſe Souls that are <hi>now in Priſon</hi> had once the Spirit of Chriſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, and alſo Evangelical Acceptance: <hi>If the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion keep the Righteouſneſs of the Law, ſhall not his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion be counted for Circumciſion; for Circumciſion is not that which is outward, in the Fleſh, but in the Man whoſe Praiſe is of God:</hi> Therefore the Law of Nature being excluded, there is an Evangelical Law excluded, which <hi>Suarez</hi> calls the Con-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law, and <hi>Gratian</hi> ſays, <hi>Jus naturale eſt quod in lege &amp; Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelio continetur;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, It is the firſt Edition of the Covenant of Grace, which two ways was publiſhed to all the World. (1.) By Natural Light, diſcovering God Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his Nature. (2.) By External Proclamation. (1.) Once to <hi>Adam,</hi> that there ſhould come a Seed of the Woman, who ſhould tread down the Head of the Serpent. (2.) In <hi>Noah;</hi> and (3.) In <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For altho' <hi>none comes to the Father, but by the Son,</hi> and there <hi>is no other Name given under Heaven by which men might be ſaved,</hi> yet it doth not follow, that particular and diſtinct Knowledge of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was abſolutely Neceſſary; for that many Infants who were ſaved have not, and the Diſciples who lived with Chriſt were doubtful about it, yea <hi>Peter</hi> forbid him to yield to Death, when he was very nigh to ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>The Third Law excluded, is the Moral Law, whereof the Decalogue, <hi>qui</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, receives all things, is the Summe: To take the Moral Law according to common Sentiments, there is by it theſe three things added to the Natural Law. (1.) A Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Inſtitution with great Solemnity from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with ſeveral Poſitive Determinations, that are not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludable by the Light of Nature. (2.) The Spiritual Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Moral Law is manifeſted; through Corruption much of the Law of Nature was obſcur'd; as whether Fornication or Uſury were Sins, or Thoughts of the Mind, before Formal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50846:68"/> or latent Inclinations to Unlawful Things? A third Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of Life and Authority to the Sanction, men very much Queſtion whether a Man was liable to Eternal Death for evil Inclinations, Yea or No? but this Law is added, becauſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, that is, both to diſcover it, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>I had not known Sin,</hi> if the Law had not informed me; ſo the Conviction of Sin was weak, until the renewed Sanction of the Law has made it more terrible: Sin gets many fair Colours; Covetouſneſs gets the Name of Frugality, until the Spirit diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover both the Sin, and the Curſe; doubtful Duties are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, weak and faint Notions reviv'd; corrupt Thoughts are corrected, the need of a Saviour more Manifeſted, and the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh State ſettled in a more perfect Condition than any State in the World. Now we find this Law is excluded, for <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin;</hi> there is no Law diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers Sin ſo as the Moral: The Natural Law diſcovers Sin, but neither ſo powerfully, nor ſo plainly; the expreſs Word of God diſcovers the Malignity of Sin, the Root and Original of Sin, and the dreadful Iſſue and Event of Sin, more plainly and clearly, and removes all thoſe Fogs and Miſts that created many doubts, by which we were apt to think great Sins ſmall, ſmall Sins none, and no Sins ſo hateful in the ſight of God as they are. The Ceremonial Law diſcovers Sin but by Accident, its Primitive Intention is to repreſent a Cure: We only ſee the Malignity of the Diſtemper, by the Strength and Power of the Medicine; the firſt Edition of the Natural Law was to direct to Duty, and to prevent ſinning, but the principal end of this Edition is to make Trangreſſors ſenſible of the Number, and Aggravations of their Sin, and ſo to be a Schoolmaſter to bring to Chriſt. (2.) That Law is excluded that worketh Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. For the ſame Law cannot bring a Man both under the Curſe, and under a Bleſſing; both to be a Miniſtration of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> the ſame cannot be both matter of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Condemnation; and there is no Law renders a Man liable to Wrath as this doth; for being Guilty, Wrath is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable by it. (3.) The particular Vices nominate from the 9th. <hi>verſe</hi> to the 19th. which hinders Men from being juſtified by this Law, diſcovers this Law to be Moral, whereof they are Tranſgreſſors: The <hi>Fear of God,</hi> that comprehends inward ſpiritual Worſhip; not following the <hi>Way of Peace,</hi> that ſhews
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50846:69"/> want of Love to their Neighbour; and what can be more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual than <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of God,</hi> and <hi>Seeking of God?</hi> and in the ſecond Chapter, Theft, Murther, and Sacriledge, and want of Heart Circumciſion, are mentioned as Reaſons why they could not be juſtified by the Law. (4.) That Law and its Works are excluded, which is of univerſal Extenſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>That all the World may become Guilty before God,</hi> but that's only the Moral, which is but circumſtantially diſtinct from the Natural. (5.) All Works that we have done are excluded, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done;</hi> but all own Moral Obedience to be our Works.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The Moſaical Law is excluded: for farther Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, we may find it meet with a double Acceptation, as it is a Politick or Spiritual, concerning the Soul or Civil, a Type or Antitype, for their whole State was ſignificant: for the former, as it was their Common-wealth Law, it did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Ceremonies, the Judicial Law, and the External part of the Moral, this made up their Civil Conſtitution, and its faults were puniſhable by the Magiſtrate: It had only Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Promiſes and Penalties, and it was twofold, either moſt ſevere, as the Common Law threatning Death, for Non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to a Tittle; and this did (1.) Repreſent the Moral Law, or (2.) It was remedial, for ſmaller faults; for Types muſt not be enlarged to have overthrown the Common-Wealth, and therefore there were no Sacrifices for Murther and Adultery, and the like, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. But (2.) There was a <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> or a Remedying Law, to prevent theſe Penalties in many Caſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. If there had been in all Caſes, the Order of the Common-wealth had been turn'd into Confuſion: This we may ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.8, 9, 10, Chap. This was the Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. A Man for burying the Dead, was liable to perpetu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Exile, which was a neceſſary Moral Duty, had it not been for this Relief? Now all grant this Law literally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is excluded from our Juſtification, and ſome lay the ſtreſs meerly here, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Inſufficiency of the Law, as that which God never intended to juſtifie any Man as to Aeternal concerns by; but we ſee on the contrary, it was the inſufficiency of the Obedience that did prevent it, not the Law it ſelf. (2.) The Moſaical Law is to be taken Spiritually, and this in Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Type, muſt be twofold alſo: Either as a moſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50846:69"/> ſevere Law, requiring Perfect, Perſonal, and Perpetual Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in Thought, Word and Deed; and Threatning Death for every offence. I have proved already this Law is excluded, or 2. As a Remedy for all Tranſgreſſions and Failures, againſt that exact Law: (for the Parallel of a Remedy as to ſome offences, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. is excepted;) and this was the Law as fulfilled by Chriſt Jeſus for us, for he it was, and his Obedience who was obedient to the Death, that was repreſented by all theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies that were Tipifying Remedies under the Law; he was the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> he was the <hi>Propitiating Sacrifice,</hi> his Blood <hi>ſprinkles both Book and People,</hi> and only Purifies as to <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and this is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> by which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and by which our Mouth is ſtopt as to all boaſting, we being no ways fulfillers of it. For he alone did <hi>tread the Wine-preſs</hi> of the Fathers Wrath, of all <hi>the People there was none with him;</hi> he built the Houſe, and he ought to bear the Glory; by <hi>one Sacrifice he hath for ever perfected them that are Sanctified:</hi> They who plead for a Remedying Law to be obey'd by us, ought to find Scriptures interpreting the Typical Remedying Law to repreſent it; but they all Terminate and End in Chriſt, and therefore the Law is remedial as ſatisfi'd or obey'd by him; the Mediatorial Law is the Remedying Law. Indeed the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etiſts Interpret a Broken Heart and Contrite Spirit to be typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by the Sacrifices, becauſe called <hi>Sacrifices that God will not deſpiſe;</hi> but then they deny Chriſts Sacrifice, for the Type muſt Point at one thing, elſe it would be of an uncertain ſound; other things are by Alluſion, but nothing is more plain in all the Scripture, than that he is the Antitype of all that Remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law. The <hi>Armin.</hi> Syſtem by <hi>Limbourgh</hi> ſays, The Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our ſelves to God, as living Sacrifices, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. Or Alms and Charity, were repreſented by the Thankſgiving Offerings, not the expiatory Sacrifices; we muſt be Prieſts, in a juſtifi'd State, a fellow of the High-Prieſts, before we can offer acceptably: This was the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> and differ'd from ours only as ſymbols from expreſs Words; a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual difference in Clearneſs and Obſcurity, and rendred the promis'd Seed of the Woman bruis'd, after the manner of an Expiatory Sacrifice, the Object of the Old Teſtament Faith.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The Evangelical Law and its Works, are here compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Law of Works; for the Diſtinction lies more
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50846:70"/> in the Manner of Obedience, and Acceptance of the Works, than in the Preceptive or Sanctive Nature of the Law. (1.) The Works of all Men are excluded: <hi>by the deeds of the Law there ſhall no Fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Rom. 3.20. The Expreſſion ſeems to be borrowed from the 143<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Pſalm, v.</hi> 2. <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, for in thy ſight ſhall no Man living be juſtified.</hi> They to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writes, were Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Beloved of God, called to be Saints.</hi> Galat. 1.2, 4. They were the Churches of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia</hi> in whoſe State <hi>Paul</hi> enrolls himſelf, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our Sins: Abram</hi> is brought in here as an Example, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Works excluded from giving any Right to Juſtification, and <hi>David</hi> who was a Man according to Gods own Heart, is brought in as another Inſtance, expecting Gods imputing Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without Works. And indeed the Apoſtles Arguments for Juſtification without Works, would be of ſmall Strength againſt any Man, except Believers in Chriſt: <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And not only Profeſſors of Faith, but real Saints, being ſanctified in Heart and Life, as may be ſeen by the Apoſtles anſwer to that Objection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. The Objection lies thus: If Grace be glorified in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sin, and our own Works have no Intereſt in obtaining the Right of Pardon, then our Works are uſeleſs, but our Sin uſeful; <hi>Let's continue in Sin, that Grace may abound,</hi> and the like, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>If our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs commend the Righteouſneſs of God, how can God be Righteous in puniſhing man?</hi> Had it been the Works of any one kind of Law, that the Apoſtle had been here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, the moſt proper Anſwer had been by Diſtinction of Laws and Righteouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> thô Ceremonial Works be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet Moral Obedience is requiſite; or thô the Moral Law be excluded, and its Works, yet Evangelical Obedience is not ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50846:70"/> Evangelical Obedience, many of their Works have neither Faith as a Principle, nor Gods Glory as their End; but who did ever expect to be juſtified before God, on the account of their Sins and Tranſgreſſions? The very Pagans ſupplicate for the Pardon of ſuch Crimes, and here the Apoſtle is diſputing againſt a Company of ſeduced Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> As the Works of all Men are excluded, ſo all kind of Works are excluded: There is no Man can do any Works that can be ground of Right to Pardon or Glory. We have Apoſtolical Teſtimony for this, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt:</hi> There are in that Text four Arguments excluding Works from our Salvation. (1.)

The ill conſequent that would follow our Works being exalted to ſuch a Dignity, <hi>vsz.</hi> Boaſting, <hi>leſt any Man ſhould Boaſt.</hi> A third is from the diſtorting of Divine Order in the Method of our Salvation, by putting Works before the Promiſe: <hi>We are his Workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God had before or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> The Divine Order lies thus: (1.) A Pre-ordination unto Holineſs. (2.) An Union with Chriſt, as the great mean thrô whom its conſiſtent wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is the Bleſſing it ſelf, our being new moulded by a New Creation, for New Ends: Laſtly, comes in the reſult of all, <hi>good Works,</hi> unto good Works: Holineſs is a Poſſeſſion, it's a begun Heaven, and the Right of Title muſt be before the Poſſeſſion: Fourthly, The Reaſon is added, why they might be occaſion of Boaſting, becauſe we are the Subjects of that Grace; <hi>Should Boaſt; for we are his workmanſhip, that we ſhould walk in them:</hi> What is in us, is ours, as ſhall be prov'd; which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to what is aſſerted by the Adverſaries, that Works from Grace will not give occaſion to Glory. The like is aſſerted of the Text; <hi>A Man is juſtified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law;</hi> and <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Knowing that a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I cannot here paſs <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Exception to this laſt Text, from the Vulgar Tranſlation, which renders it thus; <hi>Niſi,</hi> Except by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo he would make the Sence run thus: A Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, except theſe Works flow from Faith; ſo that Evangelical Works

(2.) The Text ſhews, that the form of the Argument is Disjunctive, thus: A Man is either to be juſtified by the Works of the Law, or by the Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; but a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, as we may ſee.

            <p n="6">(6) His own Legal Righteouſneſs which is here renounced, comprehends his Evangelical Righteouſneſs: For, (1.) Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Righteouſneſs is a Man's own: Scripture allows the Expreſſion.

(2.) As Evangelical Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is ours, as well as <hi>Adam</hi>'s innocent Righteouſneſs, or Sinners common Gifts, for God is the Author of both, ſo it is a Legal Righteouſneſs; for a Principle and a Rule are not oppoſite; Faith's being the Principle, renders it more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, or more conformed to the Law. (3.) The very Order of the words, <hi>Being found in Chriſt,</hi> is put before, <hi>not having mine own righteouſneſs,</hi> which in order of Nature follows a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of Phariſaical Legal Righteouſneſs. The firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to wit, the Law, muſt be dead, before we be marryed to a ſecond, to wit Chriſt, as it is expreſſed <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3. (4.)

It can hardly be thought he was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his Relapſe into <hi>Phariſaiſm:</hi> But there is a greater Danger of relying on Evangelical Righteouſneſs, that needed more Watchfulneſs and Care, leaſt he ſhould over-value what he ought to Value. (5.) This Experience and Care he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes to be a Pattern and Example to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> V. 17. <hi>Be ye followers of me:</hi> Every Man is apt to value himſelf on the Righteouſneſs he has; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. the Phariſees in theirs, and the Chriſtians to whom he wrote in theirs; it allures the Eyes of every Creature; and <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. is accepted of God according to the meaſure of its Conformity; <hi>In every Nation he that fears God and works righteouſneſs is accepted.</hi> (6.) The Apoſtle would hardly dignifie Phariſaical Righteouſneſs, now ſince Converſion, with that Name: for the Pinnacle of it, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Church,</hi> was a ſin; and he diminiſhes it, when ſpeaking of it, he calls it a <hi>blameleſneſs,</hi> that is, before Men; ſo Biſhop <hi>Downam.</hi>

All the Properties and Epithets of Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, imputed by God and apply'd by Faith to us, for our Juſtification, are here expreſs'd. (1.) A Righteouſneſs <hi>by</hi> Faith, and <hi>thorough</hi> Faith, not <hi>of</hi> Faith as Fruit of the Tree. (2.)

            <p n="8">(8.) The Native Analyſis and Coherence of the Apoſtles Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in this Chapter, further proves it, which is always to me an Argument of great Moment, and the Members of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are here as evident, as in any Writings of this Apoſtle, and ſuitable to his Cuſtom and Way of Writing: After an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction in the 1ſt. <hi>ver.</hi> in the 2d. <hi>ver.</hi> there is a Caution given about ſome bitter Enemies of the Goſpel, and a Triple Character of them, <hi>Dogs, Evil-workers, Conciſion,</hi> by which it ſeems they were the old Enemies, the Phariſees. (2.) In Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. there is a Character of a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50846:73"/> in three contrary Epithets. 1. They <hi>Worſhip God in the Spirit.</hi> 2. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord.</hi> And 3. <hi>Have no Confidence in the Fleſh.</hi> This triple Character, to the 15. <hi>ver.</hi> he enlarges and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates by the Example of his own Perſon, in a retrograde Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: 1. That he had <hi>no Confidence in the Fleſh,</hi> ver. 4, 5, 6. 2. That he <hi>rejoiced</hi> in the Knowledge of the <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> and thô he put this in its proper Place, it was the Principal thing in his aim, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. his laſt Uſe, and Application from the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Chriſt in his Humiliation and Exaltation; <hi>finally my Brethren rejoice in the Lord;</hi> and might as the Principal Subject, given Method to the Chapter, as Branches to flow from it: But then one harmony would have been loſt, the Character of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the ſecond Chapter, and Character of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in the third; yet when he comes to it, it becomes on this account a new Spring to all that follows; for he divides the Reaſons of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the Knowledge of Chriſt, and highly valuing it, under theſe two Heads. (1.) Juſtification, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. And (2.) San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. For <hi>ver.</hi> 10. he repeats the Knowledge of Chriſt as Root to another Bleſſing; the former was from the value of his Death, this from the Power of his Reſurrection. So in this 10th. <hi>ver.</hi> the Third Member of the Chriſtians Character begins, <hi>Their Worſhipping God in the Spirit,</hi> their inward Holineſs, but treated with a likeneſs to its Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſecond Member or Character, to which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately United: from the 15th. <hi>ver.</hi> follows the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, preſſing and exhorting the <hi>Philippians</hi> to true Chriſtianity, as exemplifi'd by and in him: And I think they who would joſtle Chriſts Righteouſneſs out of this Diſcourſe, may with as great Confidence attempt to joſtle it out of the Bible, and out of the Chriſtian Doctrine. The hard Names and rough Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage given to the Adverſaries, is no ſufficient ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding they profeſs'd not Chriſtianity, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. he calls the falſe Apoſtles who preach'd Chriſt, <hi>Deceitful Workers,</hi> and compares them not only to Dogs, but Devils, who had chang'd themſelves into <hi>Angels of Light;</hi> their ſhining Luſtre lay in this, They preach'd Free Grace, Chriſts Meritorious Death, but the Satanicalneſs was in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their own praerequiſite to an Intereſt in it: Their <hi>Light</hi> lay in denying Phariſaical Righteouſneſs alone; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil lay in placing a legal Right in their Goſpel Obedience:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50846:74"/> Hence <hi>v.</hi> 14. it's ſaid, <hi>they transform'd themſelves into Miniſters of Righteouſneſs;</hi> they did exalt Holineſs and Righteouſneſs more highly than <hi>Paul</hi> did, and afford it a more honourable Office, <hi>viz.</hi> the giving a right to Juſtification, Adoption, and Glory: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. This was a <hi>departing from the Simplicity that is of Chriſt;</hi> they preach'd not a ſimple, but double Righteouſneſs; one of Chriſts, another of their own; and hence room for this Curriſh and Doggiſh Temper, barking againſt the Apoſtle, as an Enemy to Holineſs; They were Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, not He; and They preach'd the Spirit, the Goſpel, and Chriſt, as well as He; but a greater value They put on inhaerent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs than He. And thus as the Serpent, that incarnate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, deceiv'd <hi>Eve,</hi> ſo <hi>Theſe</hi> did the <hi>Corinthian</hi> and <hi>Philippian</hi> Churches; they were <hi>a Conciſion,</hi> the Word ſignifies <hi>Renters,</hi> they made Schiſms in the Church, by this New Doctrine about Inhaerent Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Arg.</hi> Is from the Order of receiving Divine Bleſſings, and the Equality in the freeneſs of the Gift. For the firſt, There is a common ſaying of <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s: <hi>Bona opera ſequuntur Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, non praecedunt Justificandum:</hi> Good Works follow a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon, they do not go before in him to be juſtified; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly.</hi> Mat. 7.18. <hi>A good Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good Fruit.</hi> John 15.5. The Branch muſt be in <hi>the Vine</hi> before it can bring forth Fruit. As to the ſecond, There is no Reaſon why Juſtification and Glorification ſhould not be as freely given, and Grace as much glorified in the Gift, as Sanctification, which is own'd to be an abſolute Gift; neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Connection or Poſteriouſneſs in Order, does not derogate from Freedom: But when the Poſteriouſneſs is by a depending Suſpenſion on our Performance, there is a Derogation: Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Free without Condition, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predestinated us unto the Adoption of Children, to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace;</hi> if the Intention was Free, why not the Execution? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to Election might stand, not of Works, but of him that calleth.</hi> Rom. 11.6. <hi>There is a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to the Election of Grace, and if by Grace, then is it no more of Works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace; but if it be of Works, then is it no more Grace, otherwiſe Works are no more Works.</hi> This Oppoſition is not between Grace and External
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50846:74"/> Works, but between the very Nature of Grace and Works; they are repugnant, they can no more be the Moral Cauſes or Motives of any one Action, than one individual thing can be White and Black in the ſame part. So our Calling is Free, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſav'd us, and call'd us with an Holy Calling; not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpoſe and Grace;</hi> as Purpoſe gives Meaſure to Calling, ſo Calling gives Meaſure to Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo Call'd;</hi> but it is equally free, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified freely by his Grace:</hi> What is wrought in the Soul by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> has no more Influence in our Juſtification, than our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification has on our being Glorified; <hi>Whom he Juſtified, them he Glorified:</hi> But Juſtification can never merit Glory, being Gods Act, but is only a Prior Bleſſing in Order: this Equality of Freedom ſolves an Objection, which is to many in appearance a great Argument for Admiſſion of our Evangelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto a Subordinate Merit, or ground of Right to our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification: The Objection is founded on theſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe is of none Effect.</hi> Gal. 2.21. <hi>If Righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in Vain.</hi> Chap. 5.4. <hi>Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of none effect to you; whoſoever of you are juſtified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> The <hi>Objection</hi> is thus formed: Our Works are no farther excluded from Juſtification, than they exclude Faith, Chriſt, and the Promiſe from Juſtification; but Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience, Goſpel or gracious Works, do not exclude Grace, for they are the Fruits of Grace; nor Faith, for they flow from it; nor the Death of Chriſt, for that has purchas'd it; nor the Promiſe, for they are conveyed through it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Goſpel Obedience is not excluded from Juſtification. <hi>Reſp.</hi> (1.) This Evangelical Obedience does not exclude Grace, Faith, Chriſt and the Promiſe, from our Sanctification, thus explain'd: Becauſe it owns good Works to flow orderly from them all, but it does not ſuffer them to have an equal Freedom in our Juſtification; becauſe theſe Works, though the Fruits of Grace, they are as much ours, as <hi>Adams</hi> Works were: For God was the Author of the Ability, by which they were wrought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when what is ours truely and properly, is a Legal or Federal Condition, in order to enjoying the one and not the other, makes a great difference between the Freedom of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50846:75"/> one and the other. All Chriſtians Experience witneſſes the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Pains and Sweat, that is neceſſary to Mortification of Luſts, and Exerciſe of Grace; and by this Opinion, we muſt look on Juſtification as the Reward of our own Labour, thô we muſt look on Sanctification as a Free Gift. (1.) In particular, there is a Derogation from the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of Chriſt; his Satisfaction to the Law was not Compleat, if our Obedience to the Law be one Penny of the Price. (2.) From <hi>Grace,</hi> that will be <hi>all</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> in this Affair, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. it will admit of no Compoſition; if <hi>Works</hi> come any way in as a Plea, they muſt either be perfect, or we muſt be condemned; for there is no Law in Scripture requires leſs than Perfection; the Law that requires Faith, requires perfect Faith; and the Law that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Patience, requires perfect Patience: Therefore we muſt fall from Grace, that is, be certainly Condemned, if juſtified by the Law: So Works won't admit of Grace, more than Grace will admit of Works; Grace will have nothing, the Law will have Perfection; the Compoſition is a Contradiction. (3.) It derogates from <hi>Faith,</hi> that is from its Office, which is <hi>alone</hi> in this Work, and that as <hi>receiving,</hi> not as <hi>doing;</hi> we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, as we are nouriſhed by our Appetite: Hence is it call'd <hi>Eating, Drinking, Hungring, Thirsting;</hi> it is the Food, not the Appetite that nouriſhes us. (4.) It derogates from the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> becauſe it Promiſes Remiſſion of Sin, Inheritance of Life freely; but this puts in an exceptive Clauſe of <hi>ſomething</hi> on our part firſt to be done. Faith will be only <hi>Applicative</hi> alone in the Office, tho' not in the Subject, or not at all; Chriſt will be alone the <hi>Meriting</hi> Cauſe, or not at all; Grace alone the <hi>End</hi> and Motive, or not at all; and therefore theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as ſtrong againſt Compounders of Grace and Works, as againſt Oppoſers; becauſe the Compounding, is an Oppoſing Divine Wiſdom and Order: A Man that Digs, tho' the Spade be borrow'd of his Maſter, will not think his Wages Charity at Night, but on as exact Juſtice due, as he that digg'd with his own: A Man that walks twenty Miles a day, after his Lame Leg reſtor'd, will never impute the Journey to the Phyſician. And thus Chriſt, and Free Grace, tho' inabling us to Work, would loſe their Honour and Glory in Juſtification.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the laſt part of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Law we may be justified by,</hi> without ground and danger of boaſting,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50846:75"/> which is the <hi>Law of Faith:</hi> All Chriſtians are generally agreed that this Law is the <hi>Evangelical Law,</hi> the Law of <hi>Chancery</hi> or <hi>Equity;</hi> but all are not agreed about the Nature and Kind of that. All agree that there can be no Salvation, or Juſtification by the Moral Law, in its full Rigour, requiring Perfect, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and Perpetual Obedience, requiring the Righteouſneſs of our <hi>Perſons</hi> as well as our <hi>Works</hi> ſince Sin: There muſt be ſome Room for Equity, or none for Hopes; there is a Triple Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Equity, ſome applies it to the Sanction of the Law, ſome to the Duty of the Law, and ſome to the Perſons ſubject to the Law. The firſt is <hi>Originiſme,</hi> ſaying, the Equity lies in the Mitigation of the Puniſhment; an Eternal Death by Deſert, is turned into a Temporary by Juſtice of Equity, and a Perpetual Hell into a Tranſitory Purgatory. The ſecond Opinion applies it to the Duty and Works of the Law; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was required Perfect Obedience, now imperfect will ſerve, if it be Sincere: Divine Government is content to take a Penny in a Pound, and of this Way there are ſeveral Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny Chriſts Deity and Satisfaction, do hold that it's of meer Soveraign Mercy; but <hi>Arminians</hi> and Papiſts hold the Merits of Chriſt as the Fruit of that Soveraign Mercy, to be the immediate Foundation of this Juſtice of Equity: They ſay he has Conditionally died for all, and ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this new <hi>Law of Faith</hi> is the Condition, which they ſay is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Faith,</hi> from the Facility and Eaſineſs of obeying it; becauſe it requires no more Obedience, but with a Proportion to our Faith, and the Meaſure of our Faith is the Perſpicuity and Aſſurance of Divine Revelation. The <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> deny Merit, but that is from the Odium of the Word only; for <hi>Crellius</hi> the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſays, No Maſter of Juſtice and Equity would rob his Servant of a due Reward, for a fault or two; God would not lay ſuch a ſnare in the way of Wicked Men, to deprive them of Hopes, and diſcourage them from Duty: And <hi>Poppius</hi> the Arminian, deſcribes the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> by thoſe Works that conſiſt in Obedience to the Commands of God and Chriſt, and on reſpect to which depends the Reward of Eternal Life; yea, which he is not to have without the Work be <hi>Plenè Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> intirely and fully Perfect: And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> mean no more by Merit; they do not think their Works merit Heaven by a ſtrict Commutative Juſtice, that is us'd in Bargains; nor
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50846:76"/> Diſtributive, in the rigour of the firſt Covenant; but in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice attemper'd with Equity, and tinctur'd with the meriting Blood of Chriſt; a Juſtice ariſing between a Foederal Promiſe, and the moſt mean Condition: And the Sincere, as well as Learn'd Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays, in his <hi>Catholick Theology,</hi> he only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from them in the Word, becauſe offenſive, and that we ought rather to rejoice the Papiſts have ſo much Truth among them, than reject the Truth becauſe they hold it: But whether he dy'd in this Opinion, that our Works gave ſuch a Right to the Reward, I doubt; for in his little Book againſt Dr. <hi>Criſps</hi> Errors, he ſays, <q>I formerly believ'd the formal Nature of Faith to lye in <hi>Conſent</hi> (as he elſewhere explains it, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Conſent, that binds to all the Duties of the Married State, and ſo gives Right to all the Priviledges,) but now ſays he, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Recant it, (which he could not do ſo often as he us'd, without great Meaſures of Humility;) I believe, ſays he, it lies in <hi>Truſt;</hi> this makes the Right to lie in the Object, for it is <hi>I</hi> depend on Chriſt, as the Matter or Merit of my Pardon, my Life, my Crown, my Glory.</q> But thirdly, the Goſpel, which is the equal Interpretation of the Law in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, plainly teaches us, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Equity, is to be apply'd to the Subject of the Law; and the Law by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Juſtice requir'd Death; but there was place for Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in change of Perſons; a Sponſor or Surety might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to dye; and ſome way there muſt be <hi>Infiniteneſs</hi> in the Death, becauſe an <hi>Infinite Majeſty</hi> offended; but the Law left it doubtful, whether the Infiniteneſs muſt be in the <hi>Duration</hi> of Suffering, or <hi>Dignity</hi> of the Sufferer; and Equity has interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it of the latter: As if a Father was permitted to ſuffer for a Son, or a Summe ſhould be paid in <hi>Gold,</hi> which the Words of the Law required to be paid in <hi>Silver,</hi> or Copper: For Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) a Correction of the Law, wherein it is deficient in Words, by reaſon of its Univerſality: Or I think better, an Explication of the Words of the Law, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of the Law-giver, in an extraordinary emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Caſe: Or as <hi>Crellius</hi> ſays, it is a Juſtice mixt with Mercy; or a Virtue mitigating the Acrimony of the Law from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Circumſtances; as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>The Wiſdom that is from above, is Pure, Peaceable, Gentle, and Eaſie to be entreated; full of Mercy and good Fruits; the Fruit of Righteouſneſs is ſown
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50846:76"/> in Peace.</hi> And thus generally Proteſtants expound the <hi>Equity</hi> of the Law, to be Gods admitting, yea giving Chriſt as a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for us; he was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> as a ſubſequent Surety. The firſt Covenant did not ſay, <hi>Thou Adam</hi> (either firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam) ſhalt die;</hi> for then the firſt Covenant had been the Covenant of Grace ſtill, there was no need of another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth ſtrenuouſly prove; but when we were under the Curſe of the Law, he came in and took our Room, and became <hi>a Curſe</hi> to redeem us from it, and the Law as fulfilled by him for us, is to us truly a Law of Faith, according to the Text: For farther Explication and Confirmation of which, I ſhall propoſe theſe four Heads. Firſt, That all the Functions and Offices of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, all he ſaid, and did, or ſuffered, was in Obedience to a Law. Secondly, I ſhall a little explain the Nature of this Law and its Righteouſneſs. Thirdly, That Law he did fulfill for us, in our Room and Stead. Fourthly, That Law and its Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is to us a Law of Faith, and conſequently the Law here mentioned in the Text, it is not propoſed to us as a Rule of our Obedience, but as a matter of our Faith; yea our Faith Intereſts us in it, and makes its Righteouſneſs effectively ours.</p>
            <p>For the Proof of the firſt, We find by Eternal Compact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son, in the Mediatorial Covenant, the Son came under a Mediatorial Law: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7, 8, 9. In that Emphatical Account of it, we may make theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations. (1.) There was a Compact by which he calls God <hi>his</hi> God: <hi>O my God.</hi> (2.) By Vertue of that Covenant which was recorded in the Volume of the Book, his place was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Servant, <hi>Lo I come;</hi> I am ready to obey. (3.) His Service was to fulfill the Divine Will. <hi>I delight to do thy Will.</hi> (4.) This Will was a Legal Will: <hi>Thy Law is within my Heart;</hi> for Law is a juſt act of a Superiors Will. (5.) The Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to be a Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which Will we are ſanctified, through the Offering of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all.</hi> (6.) That no other Sacrifice either pleaſed God without this, or but this; <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings thou didſt not deſire.</hi> 2. By Vertue of this undertaking, the Son became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Obligation to ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y this Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 24.46. <hi>And thus it behoved Christ to ſuffer, and to riſe from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50846:77"/> the Dead:</hi> Yea this Obligation did extend to the moſt Minute Particles of his Life: <hi>John</hi> 4.4. <hi>He must needs go through Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> 3. In an anſwerableneſs to this Obligation, he did all he undertook: Hence is it ſaid of him, <hi>He did all things well;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 8.28, 29. <hi>I do nothing of my ſelf, but as my Father hath taught me, I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him:</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.34. <hi>My Meat is to do the Will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his Work.</hi> Pſal. 69.4, 5. <hi>Then I reſtored that which I took not away: O God, thou knoweſt my fooliſhneſs, and my Sins are not hid from thee. John</hi> 15. It is applied to Chriſt; and <hi>Theod.</hi> in <hi>Lat. Graec.</hi> expounds it thus: <q>It is true, I am under a Guilt, and made a Curſe, but I call thee to Witneſs, from whoſe ſight nothing is hid, that the leaſt of 'em is not mine, not the ſmalleſt Sins of Folly and Infirmity; <hi>I reſtored that which I took not away;</hi> I never contracted the debt I paid; others robbed thee of thy Glory, and the World of its Harmony and Beauty, but I have reſtored it all again; thô they were mine by Imputation, they were never mine by Inherency.</q> 4. He has Divine Approbation bearing Teſtimony, that he did ſo; tho' he was condemned in the Fleſh, yet he was <hi>Justified in the Spirit,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. The Deity juſtifi'd what Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.8. <hi>He is near that justifieth me, who will contend with me?</hi> All the Miracles wrought by him were Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but eſpecially his Reſurrection: <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And declar'd to be the Son of God with Power, according to the Spirit of Holineſs, by the Reſurrection from the Dead;</hi> Then he was viſibly diſcharg'd out of the Priſon of the Grave, having ſatisfi'd Divine Juſtice, and paid the Price of Redemption to the utmoſt demand: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there ſuch a Miracle, as a Man having the <hi>Iniquity of us all</hi> laid upon him, and yet compleatly give Satisfaction, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Acquittance: He was <hi>rais'd again for our Justification;</hi> all the Elect virtually roſe in him: Hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. it is reckon'd one of the greateſt Effects of Divine Power that ever was. 5. By this Work he receives the Title of a <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> (1.) He was a Servant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldst be my Servant, to raiſe up the Tribes of Jacob;</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is deſcrib'd, to <hi>Enlighten the Gentiles,</hi> to be a <hi>Salvation to the ends of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. It was hard Service, <hi>Soul Travel,</hi> Iſa. 53. It was great Service, to bring them that <hi>ſate in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to the <hi>Glorious Light</hi> of Heaven, and the <hi>Chain'd Priſoners</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:50846:77"/> to the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Sons of God.</hi> (2.) He was a Surety; and this is evident from the other Title, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made a Surety of a better Testament.</hi> 6. His Service bears all the Denominations due, and Properties, that a Law uſes to what is regulated by it: It's call'd Work: <hi>I must work the works of him that ſent me;</hi> it was to him a <hi>Law of Works,</hi> tho' to us a <hi>Law of Faith; Obedience,</hi> Rom. 5.29. <hi>By the Obedience of one ſhall many be made Righteous;</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> often; his temper of Mind under it is call'd <hi>fear,</hi> Heb. 5.7. <hi>And was heard in that he fear'd;</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. The <hi>Form of a Servant.</hi> 7. The Rule of his Life, and Offices, is call'd a <hi>Law,</hi> Gal. 4.4. <hi>He was made under the Law;</hi> and <hi>Command,</hi> Joh. 10.18. <hi>This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have I receiv'd of my Father:</hi> He was under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Law, He was Circumcis'd; He was under the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, for He was Baptiz'd; He was under the Moral, for He was <hi>Holy, Harmleſs,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefil'd;</hi> He was under the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Law as well as its Precept, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> And all this was but a part of his Subjection to the Mediatorial Law. There is a Noble Criticiſm, on 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. The Engliſh has it thus: <hi>And is this the Manner of Man, O Lord God?</hi> But it may be tranſlated thus: <hi>This is the Law of the Man the Lord God;</hi> as <hi>Dorſcheus</hi> ſays on the 2d <hi>Pſal.</hi> 
               <q>O Wonderful, O all together wonderful Law, by which God and Man ſhould be united, and according to which an unexpected Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſhould make that this ſhould be the Prerogative of ſome individual of the Poſterity of <hi>David,</hi> that he ſhould be the Lord God!</q> 
               <hi>Oſeander</hi> inferrs a Reaſon out of the Context, the ſence of which he renders thus: <q>I underſtand thee to have ſpoken of that <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe Law requires that he ſhould be God and Man.</q> And it does not want Reaſon, for what is ſaid in the 12, 13, 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> agrees beſt to this Meſſiah, for it is ſpoken of a <hi>Seed</hi> that ſhould riſe up after his Death, which ſhould proceed out of his Bowels; but <hi>Solomon</hi> was both Born and ſet upon the Throne, before <hi>David</hi> died; yea 'tis particularly noted in the 19. <hi>ver.</hi> That this Propheſie was of <hi>his Houſe</hi> a <hi>great way off.</hi> Secondly, It is ſaid <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 16. <hi>That this Kingdom ſhould endure for ever,</hi> which is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.7. by the Duration of the Sun, Moon, and Heaven. Thirdly, He <hi>ſhall be to me a Son,</hi> verſ. 14. he notes
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50846:78"/> his peculiar Subject, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. Gods <hi>first born,</hi> Pſal. 89.28. This is the Interpretation of <hi>Calovius, Gerard, Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and <hi>Piſcator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As to the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Law and its Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. (1.) For the Law, it differs much from any other Law. 1. In <hi>Subject,</hi> Meer-man, and God-man, differ very far. 2. In the <hi>Precept,</hi> the principal thing it requires is Suffering, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>I have Power to lay down my Life; this Commandment have I receiv'd of my Father:</hi> Suffering is but in Caſe of failure in other Laws, to make them obey, annex'd by Sanction to the Law. 3. In the <hi>Work,</hi> it is the greateſt Work that ever was commanded by Law, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>To bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captive, and open the Priſon-doors to them that are bound.</hi> Act. 3.21. <hi>To restore all things, to reconcile ſuch Enemies</hi> as a Holy God and his Creature, become his Enemies; to Juſtifie the Guilty, Adopt Aliens, to turn an Hell into a Heaven; an extenſive Work, Earth, Heaven and Hell, he is to be employ'd about; he is to Rehead, or Recapitulate all things which are in Heaven and Earth; a Work of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Truſt ever any was in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.14. <hi>They ſhall hang upon him all the Glory of his Fathers Houſe, the Off-ſpring and Iſſue:</hi> All Veſſels hang on that Nail, that is a Glorious Throne to his Fathers Houſe. 4. In that it has no Legal Sanction, no Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, there was no need of any; ſince he was ſo ſufficient and faithful, nor no poſſibility, for the greateſt Penalty was the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Precept. 5. The <hi>Promiſes,</hi> a <hi>Name above every Name;</hi> at his <hi>Name every knee must bow,</hi> Angels <hi>Adore</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> him, he is at the <hi>Right Hand</hi> of the Throne of God.</p>

               </gap>, ſo it's expreſſed in the third of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> it is the Gift of his Grace, the Contrivance of his Wiſdom, and the Effect of his Power: It is the Gift of his Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Much more they which receive
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50846:78"/> abundance of Grace, and of the Gift of Righteouſneſs.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. It is a <hi>Grace given us in Christ before the World began, but is now made manifest:</hi> By this <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> Death is aboliſhed, and <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Immortality brought to light:</hi> God that ſo <hi>loved the World</hi> as to <hi>give his Son</hi> for them, gave all things with him; and this none of the leaſt of the Gifts, which is as freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as any other; for we are <hi>Juſtified freely by his Grace:</hi> It is alſo a Fruit of the depth of the Riches of the Knowledge of God, the Angels ſtand amazed at the Contrivance; the moſt Sagacious of them would have been non-plus'd, if asked by what Righteouſneſs a Sinner could be juſtified: It's one of thoſe things God hath prepared, that neither <hi>Eye hath ſeen,</hi> nor <hi>Ear heard,</hi> nor ever <hi>Heart</hi> conſidered; it is alſo an Effect of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power; what Power leſs could have united Divine and Humane Nature in one Perſon? What Power leſs could have made a Virgin Conceive? What Power leſs could have brought a Clean thing out of an Unclean? and Cauſed one to be born of a Woman, and partake of Humane Fleſh and Blood, and yet be Sinleſs? It is a kind of Generation none can declare; What Power leſs could have done that great Work and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he was appointed by this Law? The Angels that <hi>excell in Strength,</hi> being all put together, could never have performed a thouſand part of it; the reſtoring of all things to their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Beauty and Order; What Power leſs could bear the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Guilt; the weight of one Sin is an intolerable burden to a Soul: No Man were able to ſtand, if God ſhould mark Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; but this ſure Foundation Stone bore the guilt of the whole World, but never did yield, nor give way; did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhrink, ſplit or flinch; he is a <hi>tried Stone,</hi> and found to be a <hi>ſure Foundation;</hi> he could riſe again from the Grave not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the weight of this Grave-ſtone of Guilt. (2.) It's the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God</hi> Subjectively, becauſe the Righteouſneſs of that Perſon who is God; as the Blood of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is called the Blood of God; <hi>to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood.</hi> All the Works of his Perſon, by Reaſon of their Conformity to the Mediatorial Law, are called Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Have not ſubmitted themſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of God; for Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>end of the Law:</hi> So we ſee the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God</hi> is the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi>

               </gap> Perſon in whom the Law gained all its ends, for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50846:79"/> he obeyed all its Precepts, he ſuffered all its Threatnings, and he purchaſed all its Promiſes too. (3.) It's the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God</hi> in Oppoſition to all <hi>Humane Righteouſneſs;</hi> it's his in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to our own; he is <hi>Jehovah our Righteouſneſs,</hi> not <hi>Adam</hi>'s or Mans Righteouſneſs. (4.) It is the Righteouſneſs which alone <hi>God can accept</hi> a Sinner for; he cannot be Juſt, and yet juſtifie a Guilty Perſon, for any other Righteouſneſs but this; he is the <hi>Lamb that takes away the Sins of the World:</hi> This was the Sacrifice God was well pleaſed with; God is pleaſed with the Sacrifices of a <hi>broken Spirit,</hi> for part of Duty being Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; but for no part of the price. <hi>This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Iſa. 42.21. <hi>The Lord is well pleaſed for his Righteouſneſs ſake:</hi> Act. 13. <hi>For all that Believe, by him are juſtified from all things.

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is without Law. (1.) As to its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us; it was not directed or regulated by Ceremonial, Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or Moral Law; for tho' it may be call'd the <hi>Natural Law</hi> of a Mediator, becauſe one cannot be a Mediator without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch Duties, yet it's diſtinct from any other Law, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Natural, taken in its whole Latitude, theſe are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, as a part from the whole. (2.) It was manifeſted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law; now, for tho' the Ceremonial did repreſent it, that Diſpenſation was at an end; it was now more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Taught, the Moral never taught it. (3.) We are inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in it without Law; we cannot be intereſted in any other Righteouſneſs without obeying the Law Directing and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it; but we are intereſted in this by Believing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is witneſs'd to by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> Iſa. 2.2. <hi>Out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem: Prucknerus</hi> thus: <q>This is the <hi>Law of Faith, Rom.</hi> 3.27. The <hi>Hearing of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.2. The <hi>Word of Faith, Rom.</hi> 10.8. This is <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> the Goſpel is the Narration of all Chriſt has done for us, with the offer of it to us; and all he did was ordered by the Mediatorial Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called <hi>a Law. Hackspanus</hi> thus, "<hi>Jalkut</hi> on this place, ſays, All the Conſolations which God is to give to Man, ſhall ariſe out of <hi>Sion;</hi> for it is ſaid, <hi>Out of Sion ſhall go forth a Law.</hi>
               </q> Hence the <hi>Jews</hi> did expect their Salvation as well as we; and they bear Teſtimony that it is <hi>no new Law</hi> but a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50846:79"/> 
               <hi>new Doctrine;</hi> and the Text it ſelf calls it; <hi>the Word of the Lord from Jeruſalem,</hi> to wit, that Word which was the Subject of the Apoſtolical Sermons, which <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. was the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> Another Teſtimony we have from the 19th. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The Law of the Lord is Perfect, Converting the Soul;</hi> that by this is meant the Apoſtolical Doctrine, may be ſeen from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. where it's cited, that it was Propheſied <hi>their ſound ſhould go to the Ends of the Earth,</hi> that the Goſpel Light ſhould be as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> as that of Sun and Moon. The Papiſts pretend to prove the Corruption of the Original Text, becauſe what the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> calls <hi>Lines,</hi> both the Verſion of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> and the New Teſtament, tranſlated <hi>Sound;</hi> their ſound went unto all the Earth; but in Sence they are agreeable: For the Sun and Moon have their Courſe by Lines; which Lines do Tipifie the Travels of the Apoſtles and their Followers, or the ſpreading of a Voice by Lines in the Air: <hi>Bellarm. Capell.</hi> and <hi>Grot.</hi> think the Word was formerly read <hi>Kolam,</hi> and by Corruption turned into <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam;</hi> but the <hi>Maſora</hi> Marks it to be an once read <hi>Word;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Kolam</hi> by their marks is read fifteen times. As the Prophets bare Teſtimony to this <hi>Law,</hi> ſo they do to its <hi>Righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23.6.33.16. <hi>This is the Name whereby he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs. Abravanel</hi> reads thus, <hi>This is the Name whereby the Lord ſhall call him,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Meſſias, our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> wherein he grants the Office of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but denies his Divinity; but the Accent joining <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>our Righteouſneſs</hi> together by Appoſition, aſſerts both his Divinity and Office to bring in a Righteouſneſs. Other <hi>Jews</hi> alſo, as the <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Midraſh Tillim.</hi> So <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>To bring in Everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> it was brought in in the Time of the Humiliation of Chriſt, but was <hi>Eternal</hi> as to its Efficacy, as his Redemption is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Having obtained Eternal Redemption;</hi> and ſo is the Goſpel called <hi>Everlaſting;</hi> and likewiſe in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>He ſhall juſtifie many, for he ſhall bear their Iniquity:</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Bleſſed is he to whom the Lord will not impute Iniquity.</hi> And as all the Prophets teſtifie this, ſo the Law, both Ceremonial and Judicial, were Types of it.</p>
            <p>I come to the third thing, That Chriſt <hi>obey'd this Law</hi> for us. I ſhall leave the Examination of both Extreams to a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, and only Confirm the Truth of it in a Scripture ſtyle, from theſe four Arguments. (1.) The Metaphors. (2.) The
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50846:80"/> Types repreſenting it. (3.) The Particles ſignifying Legal Change of Places. And (4.) From the Aſſertions and Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Scripture. For the Firſt, He is called a <hi>Mediator, One God,</hi> and <hi>one Mediator.</hi> Satan was a Make-bate, but Chriſt was Peace-maker; a Mediator acts in the Room of both Perſons at diſtance; as a King and Prophet he Acts on Gods part; as a Prieſt he Acts on our Part. Secondly, He is an Advocate and Interceſſor only for us; it's a Part of his Prieſtly Office. (3.) I ſhall omit what the Reverend Mr. <hi>Brinſley</hi> ſays, That <hi>Chriſt was our Attorney,</hi> and only a little explain the Title of a <hi>Surety, Heb.</hi> 7. The great Queſtions are, (1.) What Covenant Chriſt was Surety in? And (2.) On which ſide he is? The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> ſay, He is Surety for God to us: but both againſt the Text, which makes Suretiſhip belong to his Prieſtly Office. And 2ly. Reaſon, Would any believe a Man more than God? But in which Covenant ſhall we believe him plac'd a Surety? in the Mediatorial he is Party, ſo not Surety; but the being Party in that makes him Surety in ours: The end of Security is to give ground of Truſt, when the one Party is not reſponſible, or the other diſtruſtful: And I think in both, but with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, according to their Nature: In the firſt, by way of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; in the ſecond, by way of Caution: The firſt is a Law, the ſecond a Teſtament; he became a Sacrifice by the firſt, and as a Teſtator made the ſecond; as to the firſt Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> ſays, The Legal Bond wherein he put his Name, made a five-fold Union between him and us. 1. One Legal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Law equally obliges both. 2. One Debt, he <hi>reſtor'd what he took not away:</hi> it became his Debt, tho' of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting. 3. One Payment, our Suffering is no Satisfaction; the Law can purſue none united to Chriſt. 4. One Acceptance by the Governour or Creditor. 5. One Legal Effect, what the one doth, ſtands for both; we roſe in him, and dy'd in him; he takes our Legal Condition, he was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> and under that part we were under, to wit, the <hi>Curſe;</hi> and our Names are put in his diſcharge; we ſhare of his Reward: He was <hi>made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> it is an Acceſſary Obligation, when the Surety is ſubſequent, and ſo doth not free us, we are bound to obey ſtill. The manner of Payment was by Satisfaction. The <hi>Socinians</hi> find fault with the Word, but it is Scriptural: <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.31.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50846:80"/> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is there tranſlated <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is the ſame that's tranſlated <hi>Ranſome, Attonement, Lev.</hi> 16. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.8. and the <hi>Greek</hi> anſwering it, is appli'd to Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. A <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.11. an Atonement, for theſe are but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reſpects, <hi>expiating</hi> the Crime, <hi>ranſoming</hi> of the Offender, and <hi>attoning</hi> or propitiating the Governour offended. (2.) In the Covenant of <hi>Grace,</hi> he is Surety by way of Caution and Bail, for performing of Conditions, renewing our Obedience: He became Hoſtage, that we ſhould lay down Arms, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves, if he would forgive us: <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me,</hi> Joh. 6.37. We are by the Covenant of Grace bound to keep all the Moral Law, and he is engaged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go to Heaven, we ſhall be perfect in it; he doth not believe and repent for us, but has engaged we ſhall; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not to be perform'd before we be in Covenant; but by the Covenant which Chriſt by his Spirit has brought us into, we are bound to perform it.</p>
            <p>But the Book overgrowing the deſign'd Bulk, I ſhall come to the Fourth and laſt Head, that this is a <hi>Law of Faith;</hi> which I ſhall confirm from theſe ſix Arguments. <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> that is, a Law of Faith, that is the Object of our Faith: the Phraſe is uſual; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>The Word of Faith which we Preach.</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>The hearing of Faith.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> and 1.17. <hi>Therein is the Righteouſneſs of God reveal'd from Faith to Faith:</hi> That is, ſays Sir <hi>M. Knat.</hi> in his <hi>Critical Obſervations,</hi> the Righteouſneſs that we are intereſted in by Faith, is reveal'd to our Faith, that we may believe it, and be intereſted in it; and there is great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this Title; for the Mediatorial Law is not known by the Light of Nature or Reaſon, but only by the Light of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. <hi>The Law is not of Faith;</hi> it's founded in Natural Light, but this Law is not, it is of Faith. (2.) If the Righteouſneſs we are juſtifi'd by, be the Righteouſneſs of Faith, then the Law of that Righteouſneſs is the Righteouſneſs of Faith; but the Mediatorial Righteouſneſs is granted to be ſo. (3.) If the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel be the Narration of all Chriſt did for us, in himſelf, by his Spirit, or Apoſtles, all with the offer of it to us, and all this is call'd <hi>Faith,</hi> being the Object of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Before Faith came we were under the Law;</hi> then juſtly the Law by which he was regulated in all that Affair, was the Law of Faith. (4.) Since
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50846:81"/> that Law is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o otherwiſe to us a Law, but to our Faith, not to our Works, what we ſhould do, the Mediatorial Office is too great Work for us, but it is a Meaſure to our Faith, we may and ought to believe that Chriſt did as much for us as that Law requir'd; and there are as great things provided and prepared for us, as the Promiſes annex'd to that Law did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. (5.) It is a moſt Pathetical diſtinguiſhing Character, for all others requir'd Works of Man.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is very agreeable in <hi>Matter,</hi> tho' not in <hi>Words,</hi> to the Interpretation of the Text by Proteſtant Commentators; who ſay, that <hi>Law</hi> is taken largely for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon; for the <hi>Jews</hi> call all Divine Doctrine <hi>Law:</hi> Hence are theſe Titles of their Theology; <hi>Legal Science, Doctrine of the Law, the Divine Law,</hi> and <hi>Medrilta;</hi> that is, according to <hi>Hottinger,</hi> a Comment on <hi>Exodus,</hi> about two hundred and ten Years after Chriſt, oh the 12th. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. he cites <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 29.1. <hi>Theſe are the Words of the Covenant,</hi> and thus expounds it: <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Oppoſition between the two <hi>Members</hi> in this Text doth Confirm it; for <hi>Law of Faith</hi> cannot be here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a Law requiring Evangelical Faith, as a ſpecifical diſtinct Duty from the Works the other Law did require: For firſt, Faith it ſelf is a Work; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>The Work of Faith with Power.</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.3. <hi>Remembring your Work of Faith;</hi> and in <hi>John, To Work the Work of God, is to Believe:</hi> For thus there
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50846:81"/> would be no Diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Law of Works</hi> and <hi>Law of Faith;</hi> for the Moral Law required Faith in God, and the Ceremonial Law required Faith in him that was Typified by their Sacrifices. But to come nigher to this Oppoſition, as it is explained by the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> it muſt either lie in the Object, or in the Precept, or Duty, but in none of them. As to the Object, God and Chriſt, there is no Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difference there; for either it muſt be between the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and then there muſt be three Faiths ſpecifically diſtinct: Or it muſt be between the Office and Nature, and we cannot ſay there is any greater Diſtinction there between God and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator than between God and Creator, God and Preſerver, or Governor, or Sanctifier; all which are Incitements and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of our Faith or Love, or as Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> calls it, <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Conſiderationis;</hi> or as <hi>Cloppenburgh, Objectum Formale ſub qua,</hi> but not <hi>Ratio formalis quae vel propter quam;</hi> and ſuch diſtinct Formalities make no diſtinct Worſhip or Faith. We ſee the Lords bringing the People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is ſet down as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to their Obſervation of the Moral Law: <hi>I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt;</hi> it is far from making a new Law diſtinct from the Moral; ſo Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our Redeemer, and delivering us out of the Regions of Darkneſs, and Priſons of Bondage, is the ſtrongeſt Motive that ever was; and this Sinning againſt ſuch a Motive, which is a Sin againſt the Goſpel, is the greateſt Sin; and as there is no ſpecifically diſtinct Object in the firſt Table, ſo there is none in the ſecond, to render our Evangelical Obedience to it, diſtinct from our Moral: For the Sympathizing with our Neighbour under Adverſity, as its ſaid, <hi>Bear you one anothers Burdens, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt;</hi> it is no farther remote from Loving our Brother, (being only Charity denominated from his Condition,) than not ſtealing of his goods from him, killing of him, bearing falſe Witneſs againſt him, or thoſe other Precepts are; but it's called the <hi>Law of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe that kind of Love was the Spring of all his Obedience to the Mediatorial Law; the principal part of his Work was to bear our Burden; but the <hi>Socinians</hi> are in a greater difficulty here than others, who deny the Deity of Chriſt, and yet do Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Worſhip him: Their Work ſhould be how to find out a <hi>new Table,</hi> not how to find out a <hi>new Law,</hi> to place a kind
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50846:82"/> of Obedience in that, is neither proper to God nor Man; nor are they altogether free of this Task, who thô they own the Mediator to be God, yet as ſuch talk of a ſpecifical diſtinct Law of Duties to him, from what we owe to God; as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the Ability to perform it, and the Acceptance of it, being interrupted and imperfect Duty, flows from the Goſpel; yet there is a Neceſſity that the Law it is regulated by, be the ſame Law that was broken. It was Mans Duty to Love God, to fear him, to have Faith in him, and to obey him; he has now by Sin omitted theſe Duties, what is elſe the Eſſence of his Repentance, but the repeating and renewing of it again; that he that broke the Law now keep it? If he obſerve not the Law he did violate, it is no Repentance: Repentance and Primitive Obedience differ no more than the Image of God that Man was created in, and Regeneration, which is a renewing of him to the ſame likeneſs of Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, as the Divine Nature is the rule of this Image both in one and the other, elſe it were no Image; ſo that Holy and perfect Law of God, founded on what is his due, from what he has been and is to the Creature, called the Moral Law, is the ſame Rule to our Actions; diſtinct Formalities in Objects make diſtinct Sciences and Arts, and may occaſion diſtinct Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or Acts; for it is an imperfect Law, if it reach not to every Condition of the Subject: Hence <hi>Suarez</hi> ſays, <q>The Law of Nature before and after the fall, differ only as the Acts of the ſame Law in Time of Peace and War.</q> The Law ſays one thing to a Married Man, and another to an Unmarried; it has diſtinct Statutes to every Condition, but the Law is one: A Law meets with many changes, and yet remains the ſame; as a Man doth, and is yet the ſame Man in Eſſence.

In Uſe, it may ſerve for directing the Obedient, convincing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Guilty, and be the ſame Law ſtill: So the Moral Law was that we were to be juſtified or condemn'd by in the Primitive State; that uſe of it ceaſes: when the Soveraign Prince Pardons, then the Dignity of the Interceſſor, or his own Bowels of Mercy, is his Meaſure. So God now proceeds with us according to what our Mediator has done for us, that is the Law of Faith, not according to what we have done: It is ſtrange to ſay Faith in a Mediator will juſtifie, and not Faith in God; or that Faith in God belongs not to the Moral
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50846:82"/> Law; or that its now having a Pardon for its Object, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Reward, brings it under another Law, the Angels have many a new Duty, and new Object of Faith, but their Law remains the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Law may meet with external Changes in its Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, either by Diſpenſation, when poſitive only, as the Ceremonial, or an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Abatement of the Rigor in Words, but the Law the ſame that ſuffers the change.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Law may ſuffer ſome Change in particular Precepts, which are its Integral Parts. A Man is the ſame Man ſtill, thô he loſe his Thumb: Collective Bodies are capable of Increaſe or Decreaſe, ſo <hi>Jus Collectum</hi> of Derogation, Surrogation or Erogation, but Abrogation, or Obrogation, alters the Eſſence; and until the Moral Law is Abrogate, we cannot expect one ſpecifically diſtinct from it.</p>
            <p>But the Oppoſition is perſpicuous thus: A Law that requires your Works, a Law to be obey'd by you, and a Law that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires your Faith, a Law fulfill'd by another for you, which you ought to believe, and it thus Anſwers the Argument; we are juſtified by moſt perfect Obedience, but we perform'd it not, it was Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is manifeſt from the Context and Harmony of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe; he had all along join'd the <hi>Laws</hi> and the <hi>Works</hi> together, which he excluded from Juſtification: <hi>Firſt,</hi> The pure Natural Law among the <hi>Gentiles. Secondly,</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Moſaical; now he tells us of a Righteouſneſs and a Law that we may and muſt be juſtified by, if at all; is it reaſonable or poſſible to ſeparate theſe two? <hi>Ver.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>But now the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God is manifeſted, — Even the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If the one be the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Mediator, ſurely the other is the Law of it; ſhall we ſeparate the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Faith, and the <hi>Law</hi> of Faith? The Text would not be a good Concluſion from what precedes, without this; that which he had prov'd, was, there is no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the Deeds of the Law, but only by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God: Well, ſays he, if the Caſe be ſo, <hi>Where is your Boaſting? it is excluded.</hi> He draws his Concluſion, Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over them; How? <hi>By the Law of Faith.</hi> You are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd by the Righteouſneſs of God, you are juſtifi'd in a way that excludes Boaſting; the Law of Faith excludes Boaſting,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50846:83"/> and the Righteouſneſs of God juſtifies you; do not then theſe two Coincide, the one as the <hi>Work,</hi> the other as the <hi>Command;</hi> if it were another Law, requiring a new kind of Obedience and Righteouſneſs diſtinct from what he had ſpoken of, he had drawn a Concluſion without any Premiſes: There are two things ſhould have been enlarged on. Firſt, To prove that this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as Mediator. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Whether or not this Law of Faith, referrs to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the Rule of it, or the Faith by which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Both which I muſt deferr to ſome proper Verſes in the fourth <hi>Chapter;</hi> only at preſent, as to the firſt, that 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. may perſwade any unprejudic'd Perſon; <hi>Thorough the Rsghteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> As to the ſecond, our Confeſſion of Faith ſays, We are not juſtifi'd by Faith, or that is not imputed to us it ſelf as an Act, nor any other Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obedience: But this is to be treated in <hi>ver.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Law is a Law we can be juſtifi'd by, and it is before prov'd, that we cannot be by any Law requiring Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The difficulties that attend the Explication of it, by <hi>Socinians, Arminians, &amp; aliis melioris notae,</hi> who ſay, this Law is the Law of Chriſt the Mediator, not as made under it, but as a Law-giver, requiring Faith and Repentance of us, as the Condition of an Intereſt in his Merits and Juſtification by them. I ſay the difficulties that attend it, render it the leſs credible. (1.) This <hi>Goſpel-law</hi> or <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> muſt be a perfect Law, requiring Faith in Perfection, Repentance in Perfection, and ſo other Evangelical Obedience. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> in his <hi>Examination,</hi> who is Zealous for this New Law, and who as Mr. <hi>Pitcarn,</hi> one of his many Adverſaries, ſays, is of the greateſt <hi>Acumen</hi> of the kind, he not only owns it, but proves it from Chriſts own Words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. when he was Promulgating his Law, <hi>Be ye perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> On which he thus Acutely Comments: The Commands of growth have no Bounds nor Limits, until we come to the Unity of the Faith, and the <hi>Knowledge of the Son of God,</hi> unto a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man,</hi> unto the <hi>Meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> and it is a certain Truth, that there is no Duty in the Goſpel wherein Gods Law only requires ſincere and not perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50846:83"/> 
               <hi>Patience</hi> ſhould have its <hi>perfect Work,</hi> and that's a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part of Evangelical Obedience: Either the <hi>Goſpel Law</hi> or <hi>Law of Faith</hi> muſt require Perfection of Obedience in theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or ſome other Divine Law; elſe God would become an Indulger of Sin by Law; if it be by another Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Moral,</hi> that he requires <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience, and by this <hi>ſincere</hi> only, then theſe two Laws differ but in Degree, not in <hi>Specie,</hi> or Kind; becauſe both require the ſame Duties or Works, and ſo this Goſpel Law would be no Diſtinct Law, but only the Meaſure of ſincere Obedience would receive a new uſe, which we own it has, to wit, to be an <hi>Index</hi> and Mark of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, tho' we cannot own that uſe of its giving Right; but to proceed, a diſtinct Law they muſt hold, or quit their Cauſe, or this Foundation of it; for the Text ſets the Law of Faith down as an oppoſite Law to that of Works, and that they hold. (1.) Then if it be a perfect Law, requiring perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, there is no poſſibility of Juſtification in this Life, <hi>Poppius</hi> the <hi>Arminian</hi> grants the Concluſion, that our Obedience muſt be conſummate before our Aſſurance; and others diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between a Compleat and Partial Juſtification; the former is not, they ſay, until the day of Judgment. But this is not all the difficulty; for it's the adding a Load to a Burden: Is this Goſpel, to a Man that is unable to perform the leaſt part of the Moral Law, to tell him, that God or the Mediator requires perfect Obedience to it for the Future, and another too? Or is this Goſpel, to ſay, you ſhall periſh Aeternally, and have the Fire of Hell ſeven times heated, if you obey not this Goſpel? Its indeed a Conditional Hell, but it's more dreadful than the Law-Hell, and the Condition is more impoſſible; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have leſs Power to ſhun this difficulty of two perfect Laws. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> owns no other perfect Law but this Goſpel-Law, ſince Man fell; but by ſhunning one difficulty he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two as great. (1.) Then the Moral Law is abrogated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the falſneſs of the Doctrine it ſelf, for it is impoſſible that ſhould ceaſe to be our Duty, to love God with all our Heart, and Soul; what Advantage brings Chriſts Death? To abrogate one perfct Law, and eſtabliſh another; here is little Goſpel. A ſecond difficulty is, we muſt either ſay, Chriſt has purchas'd to us Pardon for Sins againſt the Goſpel-Law, or for none at all, but that one Sin of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, if the Moral Law be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat'd;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50846:84"/> after the Fall we never ſinn'd againſt any Law but the Goſpel's, for we were under no other Law, according to him; but how contrary is this to the Nature of the Goſpel, whoſe greateſt Cordial is Remiſſion of all Sins againſt the Law: He brings a twofold Remedy or Solution to theſe Difficulties: 1. The Goſpel renders all the Duties poſſible it Commands; hence is it call'd the <hi>Power of God,</hi> and <hi>Law of the Spirit:</hi> And the Reaſon, why the Law was imperfect before the Goſpel, was, becauſe there was not Power to obey a perfect Law; God cannot Command what is impoſſible: This is no leſs oppreſs'd with Difficulty, than the Diſtemper it's brought to Cure. For (1.) Doth God loſe his Right, becauſe we loſe our Power; the Devils have no Power to obey, do they therefore not Sin? he was a <hi>Lyar and Murderer from the beginning,</hi> he continues it, doth he not Sin in it? If Sin be worſe than Suffering, and there be no Sin in Hell, Hell is better than this Earth. Some would help him at this ſtrait, with the Diſtinction of <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> Impotence; God cannot juſtly command what is Phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible, but he may what is Morally ſo; but he Scoffs at it as an Impotent Brat of <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> nurs'd by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Truman;</hi> and I think it affords little relief: For when the Impotence is inſuperable, yea more unconquerable than Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Impotence, wherein is there a greater Foundation to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, becauſe Sinners like to have it ſo? are we not Mad and Diſtracted, and may we impoſe on Fools what we will becauſe they may like it? it looks like Tickling a Man to Death. But 2dly. Granting that which is certainly falſe, that the Goſpel renders all it requires both Morally and Phyſically poſſible, it makes not the Goſpel better than the Law; for in Innocence all commanded was more than barely poſſible. But the ſecond and grand Remedy is, that thô the Law require perfect <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> yet not under the Penalty of Death; there is no Law that threatens Death to every Sin, but to particular kind of groſs Sins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. Yea only to Impenitence: This is the Goſpel Law, this is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; but ſtill difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties attend it, and divide the Parties. (1.) Some ſay, this is an <hi>aequi-juſt</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, others of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> Law. (2.) Some ſay, this is a Law and Conſtitution Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical by it ſelf, others that it is an Adminiſtration of the Law by Soveraign Power, ſet in a Throne of Grace, but not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50846:84"/> Law. (3.) Some ſay, this is proper to the Goſpel Law, others that the Moral Law did admit of it alſo; and that if <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve</hi> had had only an Inclination to eat of the Forbidden Fruit (which in the Rigor of the Law was a Sin) and refrain'd from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the Act, which was the Violation of the Covenant formally, ſhe ſhould not have dy'd: It were too operoſe to follow all theſe Tracts, the Multitude of them would render one Jealous, that they are not the Kings High-way, but ſome private Paths, that do derogate from the True and Living Way. In General, this doth Enervate the <hi>Law of God,</hi> the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> eſtabliſhes the Law, but this doth Emaſculate it, and turn it into a meer Counſel and Advice: What elſe is a Law without Sanction? Yea no Law; ſo there is no Sin but Impenitence, and indeed they call the reſt Venial <hi>peccadil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's.</hi> Secondly, It is repugnant to the Moral Law to admit of Aequity, becauſe it is moſt aequal in it ſelf; thoſe Laws admit of <hi>Chancery</hi> and Aequity, that would in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances become rigorous and cruel; but there is no ſuch thing in the Divine Law: It would be contrary to Aequity, and ſo unjuſt, to eſtabliſh a Law requiring partial Love to God, and partial Obedience. Thirdly, This Doctrine opens a door to <hi>Antinomianiſme;</hi> and Hiſtory tells us it ſprung from ſuch a Miſtake, that Faith and Repentance were taught and commanded by the Goſpel, and they contain'd all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; ſo the Law was needleſs: And <hi>Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borgh</hi> ſays much the ſame. The Goſpel needs no Law to be a Schoolmaſter to lead to Chriſt; it has more terrible Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of its own, than the Law has, to <hi>drive</hi> men to Chriſt with, that Scripture Phraſe belongs to the Ceremonial Law. Fourthly, This would put an Honour on the Mediatour above God, that Imperfect Obedience to his Law might merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or what is of as much worth, an Intereſt in Chriſt a right to his Merits; but no leſs than Perfect Obedience to Gods Law can merit it. Fifthly, It would much derogate from Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who is now content to give his Favour and his Rewards on eaſier rates than before; he would have had perfect Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, now partial will ſerve: And conſequently, Sixthly, <hi>Boaſting</hi> would not be excluded by the Law of Faith; for Man might boaſt God was come to Eaſier Terms; he ſhould loſe Glory by the change of the Covenants, not gain.
